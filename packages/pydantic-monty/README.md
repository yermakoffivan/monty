# pydantic-monty

Python bindings for the Monty sandboxed Python interpreter.

Execution always happens in a pool of `monty` worker subprocesses: a monty
process can never be made fully crash-proof against memory errors (stack
overflows, allocator aborts) triggered by adversarial input, so crash
isolation is built in. A crashed worker raises `MontyCrashedError` and is
replaced transparently — your process is never at risk.

## Installation

```bash
uv add pydantic-monty
# or
pip install pydantic-monty
```

`pydantic-monty` is a metapackage with no code of its own; it installs the two
distributions that make up a working sandbox:

- [`pydantic-monty-client`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-monty-client/) —
  the `pydantic_monty` module you import (pool, sessions, value conversion)
- [`pydantic-monty-runtime`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-monty-runtime/) —
  the `monty` worker binary the pool spawns, shipped the same way `uv` and
  `ruff` ship their binaries

Install `pydantic-monty-client` on its own when the worker binary comes from
somewhere else — a base image, a system package, a build of this repo — and
point `pydantic_monty` at it via `MONTY_BIN`, `binary_path=`, or `PATH`.

## CLI

Usage without installing via [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/):

```bash
uvx pydantic-monty --help
```

`uvx pydantic-monty` runs a REPL, or `uvx pydantic-monty <file>` runs a file.

Or to install `monty` locally, run

```bash
uv tool install pydantic-monty-runtime
# then to run the repl:
monty
# or run a file:
monty <file>
# or for help:
monty --help
```

Within an environment that already has `pydantic-monty` installed,
`python -m pydantic_monty` runs the same binary.

## Usage

### Basic execution

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        print(session.feed_run('1 + 2'))
        #> 3
```

`Monty()` is a pool of workers; `pool.checkout()` dedicates one worker to a
REPL session. Session state persists across `feed_run` calls:

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        session.feed_run('x = 40')
        print(session.feed_run('x + 2'))
        #> 42
```

### Async

`AsyncMonty` is the asyncio counterpart: worker I/O runs off the event loop,
and external functions may be coroutines.

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic_monty import AsyncMonty


async def fetch(url: str) -> str:
    await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
    return f'contents of {url}'


async def main():
    async with AsyncMonty() as pool:
        async with pool.checkout() as session:
            result = await session.feed_run(
                "await fetch('https://example.com')",
                external_lookup={'fetch': fetch},
            )
    print(result)
    #> contents of https://example.com


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Input variables and external lookup

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        result = session.feed_run(
            'double(x) + y',
            inputs={'x': 5, 'y': 1},
            external_lookup={'double': lambda x: x * 2},
        )
    print(result)
    #> 11
```

### Host objects and classes

Wrap a host object in `ClassInstance` to let the sandbox read chosen attributes and call chosen methods on it, or a
class in `ClassType` with `init=True` to let sandbox code construct it; every policy is an allow-list, and the sandbox returning the
object hands you the original back.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_monty import ClassInstance, ClassType, Monty


@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int

    def greeting(self) -> str:
        return f'hi {self.name}'


person = Person(name='Samuel', age=4)
with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        wrapper = ClassInstance(person, eager_attrs='all', allowed_methods={'greeting'})
        code = 'assert user.greeting() == "hi Samuel"\nuser'
        result = session.feed_run(code, inputs={'user': wrapper})
        print(result is person)
        #> True
        wrapper = ClassType(Person, init=True, instance_eager_attrs='all')
        print(session.feed_run('Person("Ada", 36).name', inputs={'Person': wrapper}))
        #> Ada
```

Method return values are not wrapped automatically: override `convert_value` to wrap derived objects with policies you
choose (each wrapper is kept by the session until it closes). Instances defined inside the sandbox arrive as read-only
`MontyClassProxy` stand-ins. See the [host objects docs](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/docs/host-objects.md).

### Snapshots: pausing and resuming execution

`feed_start` is the suspendable counterpart of `feed_run`: instead of driving a
snippet to completion, it hands control back at each external call, OS call,
name lookup, or future resolution as a *snapshot*. You answer with
`snapshot.resume(...)`, which returns the next snapshot or a `MontyComplete`.

```python
from pydantic_monty import FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        snapshot = session.feed_start('greet(name) + "!"', inputs={'name': 'Ada'})
        assert isinstance(snapshot, FunctionSnapshot)
        print(snapshot.function_name, snapshot.args)
        #> greet ('Ada',)
        result = snapshot.resume({'return_value': 'hello Ada'})
        assert isinstance(result, MontyComplete)
        print(result.output)
        #> hello Ada!
```

To iterate a snippet to completion without answering each suspension by hand,
pass an `external_lookup` (and/or `os`) to `feed_start` and drive with
`snapshot.resume_auto()`, which resolves each external call and name lookup from
them automatically — the same resolution `feed_run` performs, but one step at a
time so you can inspect or `dump()` each snapshot along the way:

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyComplete

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        snapshot = session.feed_start(
            'greet(name) + "!"',
            inputs={'name': 'Ada'},
            external_lookup={'greet': lambda n: f'hello {n}'},
        )
        while not isinstance(snapshot, MontyComplete):
            snapshot = snapshot.resume_auto()
        print(snapshot.output)
        #> hello Ada!
```

On `AsyncMonty`, `external_lookup` callables may be coroutine functions and
`resume_auto` is awaitable (`snapshot = await snapshot.resume_auto()`); a
coroutine external is awaited concurrently and settled via an
`AsyncFutureSnapshot`.

`snapshot.dump()` serializes the paused worker to bytes; a fresh session's
`load_snapshot` restores it and returns the snapshot to resume. This lets you
checkpoint execution and continue it later, even in a different process:

```python
from pydantic_monty import FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        snapshot = session.feed_start(
            'fetch(url)', inputs={'url': 'https://example.com'}
        )
        blob = snapshot.dump()

    # later — restore into a fresh session and resume
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        snapshot = session.load_snapshot(blob)
        assert isinstance(snapshot, FunctionSnapshot)
        result = snapshot.resume({'return_value': 'page contents'})
        assert isinstance(result, MontyComplete)
        print(result.output)
        #> page contents
```

If the paused feed used filesystem `mount`s, re-supply the same ones to
`load_snapshot(blob, mount=...)` — their host paths are not stored in the dump.

`session.dump()` between feeds serializes an idle session instead; restore it
with `session.load_session(blob)` (which returns `None`) and keep feeding. Both
`load_session` and `load_snapshot` are valid only on a fresh session, before
any feed; using the wrong one for a dump's kind raises. `AsyncMonty` sessions
expose the same `feed_start` / `load_session` / `load_snapshot`, with awaitable
`resume(...)`.

### Resource limits

Limits are enforced inside the worker; the pool's `request_timeout` is a
host-side backstop that kills a hung worker outright. An installed telemetry
adapter invokes trusted Python SDK callbacks synchronously; enforcement is
delayed while such a callback runs. `max_duration_secs`
limits cumulative *execution* time — the clock runs only while the
interpreter executes, never while suspended waiting on the host, and
accumulates across feeds. The worker reports its execution time on every
protocol turn, and sessions with the limit are additionally killed
`duration_limit_grace` (1s, not currently configurable from Python) after
the remaining budget expires, covering hangs the in-sandbox limit cannot
catch (its check only runs at interpreter checkpoints). `max_suspensions`
is enforced by the pool itself: it counts the host round trips (external
functions, `os` callbacks, name lookups) it services per checkout, and the
one past the budget ends the feed with an uncatchable `RuntimeError`.

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyRuntimeError

with Monty(request_timeout=10) as pool:
    with pool.checkout(limits={'max_duration_secs': 0.1}) as session:
        try:
            session.feed_run('while True:\n    pass')
        except MontyRuntimeError as exc:
            print(exc.display(format='type-msg').split(':')[0])
            #> TimeoutError
```

### Type checking

Monty bundles [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/): each fed snippet can be
type-checked inside the worker before it runs, with successfully executed
snippets accumulating into the checking context.

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyTypingError

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout(type_check=True) as session:
        try:
            session.feed_run("x: int = 'not an int'")
        except MontyTypingError as exc:
            print('invalid-assignment' in exc.display())
            #> True
```

`type_check_format` picks the rendering — ty's `'full'` (the default: source
snippet and carets), `'concise'`, `'azure'`, `'json'`, `'jsonlines'`,
`'rdjson'`, `'pylint'`, `'gitlab'` or `'github'` — and `type_check_color` adds
ANSI colour to `'full'` and `'concise'`. Both are `checkout()` arguments rather
than `display()` arguments because the diagnostics are rendered inside the
worker: ty's structured diagnostics resolve their spans against the type
checker's database, so only the rendered text crosses the wire.

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyTypingError

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout(type_check=True, type_check_format='concise') as session:
        try:
            session.feed_run("x: int = 'not an int'")
        except MontyTypingError as exc:
            print(exc.display())
            """
            main.py:1:10: error[invalid-assignment] Object of type `Literal["not an int"]` is not assignable to `int`
            """
```

### Crash/failure isolation

Every failure in monty code execution raises a subclass of `MontyError`.

```python test="skip"
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyError

hostile_code = '...'

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        try:
            session.feed_run(hostile_code)  # even a segfault is contained
        except MontyError:
            ...  # the worker died; the pool already replaced it
```
