# `with` statement (context managers)

Monty supports the `with` statement for built-in types that implement
`__enter__` / `__exit__` (currently just file objects produced by `open()`,
see [open.md](open.md)) **and for user-defined classes** that define the two
dunders. Semantics follow CPython for the supported subset: `__enter__` runs
before the body, `__exit__` runs on every exit path (normal completion,
exception, `return`, `break`, `continue`), and a truthy return from
`__exit__` suppresses an in-flight exception.

User-class `__enter__` / `__exit__` run as real frames, so unlike
`__repr__` / `__str__` (see [classes.md](classes.md)) they may suspend on
external/OS calls and resume mid-`with`. The protocol check matches CPython:
a value whose class lacks `__exit__` raises
`TypeError: '...' object does not support the context manager protocol (missed __exit__ method)`; one with
`__exit__` but no `__enter__` gets the `(missed __enter__ method)` variant.
Lookup is type-level, as in CPython: an instance attribute named
`__enter__`/`__exit__` is ignored by the `with` statement, but used by an
explicit `obj.__enter__()` call, which is an ordinary method call.

## Supported but desugared

- **Multiple context managers in a single `with`** (`with a() as x, b() as y:`)
    is parsed as semantically equivalent nested `with` blocks: the leftmost
    manager enters first and exits last. This matches CPython's left-to-right
    enter, right-to-left exit ordering exactly. Tracebacks point at the
    inner-most `with` line, not the original multi-item line.

    Each extra item counts against the parser's nesting budget as if it were
    written as explicitly nested `with` blocks; see
    [language.md](language.md).

## Not supported

- **Async `with`** (`async with EXPR:`) is rejected at parse time with
    `SyntaxError: async context managers (async with) is not yet implemented`.
- **`contextlib`** (`@contextmanager`, `ExitStack`, etc.) — the module is not
    available; only the language-level `with` statement is.

## Behavioural divergences

- The third argument to `__exit__` (the traceback object) is always `None`.
    Monty has no traceback objects; the type and value arguments are passed
    through unchanged (`typ is ValueError` etc. works). Code that inspects the
    traceback object inside `__exit__` sees `None` where CPython would
    provide a `traceback` instance.
- If `__exit__` itself raises during the exception path, the new exception
    replaces the original and the original is dropped. This matches CPython's
    behavior, and is listed here because some readers expect the original
    to be preserved as `__context__`; Monty does not track exception chaining.
- CPython's `BEFORE_WITH` looks up **and binds** `__enter__`/`__exit__` once,
    when the `with` statement is entered; Monty's `WithExit`/`WithExceptStart`
    opcodes look `__exit__` up again when the block exits. A class whose
    `__exit__` attribute is reassigned *during* the body calls the new
    function in Monty but the originally-bound one in CPython, and a
    reassignment that removes it raises `AttributeError` in Monty where
    CPython would still call the original.
- Direct `obj.__exit__(typ, val, tb)` invocation on a **built-in** context
    manager forwards `val` to the type's `py_exit` only when it is `None` or a
    heap-allocated value, matching CPython for the `None` / exception-instance
    cases real callers use. A non-`None` *scalar* `val` (e.g.
    `f.__exit__(int, 5, None)`) cannot be expressed through the internal
    `Option<HeapId>` abstraction and is treated as if `val` were `None`. Every
    built-in context manager ignores `val`'s content beyond `is None`,
    so this is not observable in practice. User-class instances are exempt:
    their explicit dunder calls are ordinary method calls and receive all
    three arguments verbatim.
- Direct `obj.__exit__(...)` on a **built-in** context manager requires
    **exactly three** positional arguments; any other arity raises
    `TypeError`. CPython's file/`IOBase.__exit__` is declared `*args` and
    accepts any number, so `f.__exit__()` returns `None` there but raises in
    Monty. User-class `__exit__` is an ordinary method, so its arity matches
    whatever the user defined, exactly as in CPython.

## Current implementers of the protocol

| Type         | Notes                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `open()`     | Closes the file on exit; see [open.md](open.md) for details. |
| user classes | Class must define `__exit__` (and `__enter__`); see above.   |

Adding a new context-manager-capable built-in takes three pieces on the
type's `HeapRead` impl:

1. Override `PyTrait::py_is_context_manager` to return `true`. The
    `BeforeWith` opcode checks it to raise CPython's specific `TypeError` for
    non-CM values, *before* `py_enter` runs.
1. Override `PyTrait::py_enter` / `PyTrait::py_exit`.
1. Add the type's arms in `HeapReadOutput::py_is_context_manager`,
    `py_enter`, and `py_exit` (in `heap_data.rs`) so the dispatch
    reaches the overridden methods.

Direct `obj.__enter__()` / `obj.__exit__(...)` invocation on built-in types
is wired centrally in `VM::call_attr` via `dispatch_dunder`, so no per-type
`StaticStrings::Enter` / `StaticStrings::Exit` arms are needed in the
type's `py_call_attr`. Instances skip that interception and use normal
method dispatch.
