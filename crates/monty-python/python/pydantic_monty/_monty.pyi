    The directory is opened here, and every feed this mount is passed to serves
    that same directory — so build one and reuse it. `'overlay'` writes live in
    each feed's own table and are discarded when the feed ends.

    **Warning: `mode='read-write'` writes files from untrusted code to your
    real filesystem.**

    Those files are untrusted input; do not execute them. Importing counts as
    executing, and the import can be indirect: with a directory on `sys.path`
    mounted, sandboxed code can write `json.py`, or any module not yet
    imported, and the next `import` runs it. That includes imports made by
    `pydantic_monty` itself. `sys.path[0]` is the script's directory, or the
    cwd for `python -m`, `python -c` and the REPL.

    Tools also read files without an explicit import: `conftest.py`,
    `sitecustomize.py`, `.git/hooks/*`, `Makefile`, `.env`, `__pycache__`.

    The `'overlay'` default keeps writes in memory, so nothing reaches the host
    filesystem. Use `'read-write'` only with a directory that contains no code
    or config and is not on `sys.path` or any other execution path.

    ```python
    from pathlib import Path

    from pydantic_monty import Monty, MountDir

    with Monty() as pool, MountDir(host_path=Path('host-dir'), virtual_path='/data') as mount:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            contents = session.feed_run("open('/data/notes.txt').read()", mount=mount)
    ```

    The directory is held open from construction until the mount is closed, not
    for the duration of a feed — so reusing one across feeds is free, and works
    the same inside a `with` block or outside it. `with` (or `close()`) is what
    hands the directory back; feeds passed a closed mount raise `ValueError`.
    Without it the directory stays open until the object is collected: a file
    descriptor on Unix, but on Windows that blocks renaming or deleting it.

                raises if it doesn't exist, isn't a directory, or cannot be
                opened — on macOS/BSD a search-only (`0o111`) directory is not
                mountable, though Linux accepts one. Sandbox code can never see
                this path or reach outside it. The mount tracks the directory
                itself rather than its name, so renaming it on the host does
                not detach the mount; on Windows the open handle prevents the
                host renaming or deleting it at all while the mount lives.
                Symlinks inside it are followed only if their targets are
                relative — an absolute target raises `PermissionError` in the
                sandbox even when it points back into the same mount.
            virtual_path: Absolute POSIX-style path prefix inside the sandbox
                (e.g. `'/data'`), regardless of host OS. Raises `TypeError`
                if not absolute.
            mode: `'read-only'` — reads only, writes raise `PermissionError`;
                `'read-write'` — writes through to the host directory, where
                the files persist after the feed (see the warning above);
                `'overlay'` (default) — reads fall through to the host, writes
                are captured in memory per feed and discarded when it ends.
            write_bytes_limit: Cap on cumulative bytes written through the
                mount within one feed; exceeding it raises `OSError` in the
                sandbox. `None` (default) means unlimited.
            memory_usage_limit: Per-mount budget in bytes (default 100 MB,
                matches DEFAULT_MEMORY_USAGE_LIMIT in rust) shared by retained
                overlay data and transient filesystem results; an operation that
