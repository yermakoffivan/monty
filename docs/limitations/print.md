# `print()`

Output always goes to the host via a print callback (`vm.print_writer`). The
host decides where it ends up; there is no real `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`
underneath (see [sys.md](sys.md)).

## Supported keyword arguments

- `sep=...` — separator between arguments. `None` falls back to a single
    space. Must be a `str` or `None`; otherwise `TypeError`.
- `end=...` — appended after the last argument. `None` falls back to `"\n"`.
    Must be a `str` or `None`; otherwise `TypeError`.

## Rejected / ignored

- `file=...` — only `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are accepted; both are
    opaque markers matched by identity (see [sys.md](sys.md)). Anything else
    raises `TypeError: "print() 'file' argument must be sys.stdout or sys.stderr, not {type}"`,
    including an object defining `write()`, which CPython would call. CPython
    instead raises `AttributeError: '{type}' object has no attribute 'write'`
    for an object without one.
- `flush=...` — accepted and ignored. Output is delivered to the host through
    the subprocess protocol on its own schedule (see "Chunk boundaries" below);
    a `print()` cannot make it arrive sooner.
- Any other keyword raises `TypeError: ... unexpected keyword argument`.

## Behaviour

- Each positional argument is converted via `py_str` (equivalent to `str(x)`)
    before being written.
- The host callback receives formatted chunks. There is no atomicity guarantee
    across multiple `print()` calls if the host interleaves with other output.
- Stderr output is delivered through the same callback with `stream='stderr'`.
    `CollectString` keeps no labels and interleaves both streams in one buffer;
    `CollectStreams` labels each entry.

## Chunk boundaries

Chunk boundaries carry no meaning. The worker holds output in a buffer and
sends it when the buffer reaches roughly 8 KiB or its oldest byte has waited
out the flush interval (5 ms by default), so:

- One `print()` can arrive in several callbacks, and several `print()` calls
    can arrive in one. A chunk does not correspond to a call, a line, or an
    argument.
- Output that is printed and then followed by silence is released by the
    interpreter's periodic checkpoint, so it does not wait for the next
    `print()`.
- That checkpoint sits in the bytecode dispatch loop, so it only fires between
    instructions. One long native operation — a large `sort`, a regex scan,
    `json.dumps` over a big structure — holds whatever was buffered for as long
    as it runs, however short the interval. This is the one case where the
    interval does not bound the wait. The output is late, never dropped: the
    buffer is still drained before the next host call and at the end of the
    turn, so a host that needs liveness here can set the interval to 0 and get a
    callback as each line is written.
- Both streams share that one buffer, so output alternating between them is
    batched like any other; the callback is still called once per run, so a
    chunk never mixes the two.
- Ordering is exact, between the streams as well, and the buffer is always
    drained before a host call or the end of a run, so output cannot arrive
    after the event it preceded.
- Buffered output is lost if the worker dies *hard*: the pool killing it on
    `request_timeout`, the allocator ending the process at its hard memory
    ceiling, or a crash. A graceful turn drains first, so this only affects a
    worker that never finished — but the window is up to 8 KiB or one flush
    interval of already-complete lines, where line buffering would have sent
    them. A host that would rather have that output than the batching (to see
    what a snippet printed before it hung, say) can set the interval to 0.

Hosts can set the interval per session: `print_flush_interval` (seconds) in
`pydantic_monty`, `printFlushInterval` (seconds) in `@pydantic/monty`, and
`ReplConfig::print_flush_interval` in Rust. `0` turns the timer off and
restores line buffering, one callback per completed line. The wire carries
whole milliseconds, so a positive interval under 1 ms is sent as 1 ms rather
than rounding down into that sentinel, and a negative or non-finite value is
rejected at checkout.

The wasm worker takes the same setting, but it does not stream: a turn's
frames all reach the host together when the turn ends, whatever the interval.
What the setting still decides there is how that output is *split* — one print
callback per frame, and a collector charges its cap per frame — so a snippet
that hangs or is killed yields nothing either way.

## Callback failures

In the Python and JavaScript pool APIs, a print callback that raises aborts the feed after the current protocol turn,
not at the offending `print()`.
Sandboxed code cannot catch the callback's exception.
If the turn suspended, both bindings discard the session; later feeds on it fail.
Check out a fresh session before running more code.

## CollectString / CollectStreams caps

`CollectString` and `CollectStreams` (Rust `PrintWriter` variants and the
matching `pydantic_monty` collectors) accumulate print output in **host-side**
buffers. That growth is **not** covered by `ResourceLimits.max_memory`
(heap-only, and in the pool only on the worker).

- Default cap: **10 MiB** (`DEFAULT_MAX_PRINT_COLLECT_BYTES`).
- Exceeding the cap fails with `memory limit exceeded: {used} bytes > {limit} bytes` (same wording as heap
    `ResourceError::Memory`), but *what raises* and
    *who can catch it* differ by host:
    - **In-process Rust** (`PrintWriter::CollectString`/`CollectStreams`): the
        error is raised inside the VM as an ordinary `MemoryError`, so sandboxed
        code **can** catch it with `except MemoryError`. Unlike a real resource
        limit it is a catchable `RunError::Exc`, not `UncatchableExc`.
    - **Pool hosts** (`pydantic_monty`, `@pydantic/monty`): the cap is enforced
        in the parent as print events arrive, so it fails the protocol *turn*
        rather than raising into the VM. Sandboxed code cannot catch it, and the
        host sees `MontyRuntimeError` whose inner exception is `MemoryError`
        (`exc.exception()` in Python, `err.exception.typeName` in JS). The JS
        check is its own TypeScript implementation
        (`crates/monty-js/ts/print.ts`), not the Rust `PrintWriter`.
- Pass `max_bytes=None` to disable the cap (trusted hosts only).
- Every `CollectStreams` also charges a fixed **64 bytes** per retained entry
    toward the cap, since a retained entry costs vector and `String` bookkeeping
    that is not text: without it, output alternating between the streams would
    hold roughly 64x the host memory the cap accounts for. So the cap bounds
    entries as well as payload, and a run collects less text than `max_bytes`
    suggests — a fragment per entry caps out at `max_bytes / 65` of them.
    Rust `PrintWriter::CollectStreams` merges consecutive same-stream fragments,
    so an ordinary `print()` pays the overhead once.
- Entries follow the chunk boundaries above, not `print()` calls: several
    prints usually collect into one entry. Set `print_flush_interval=0` to get
    one entry per completed line.
- JS (`@pydantic/monty`): `CollectString` / `CollectStreams` accept `maxBytes`
    (camelCase), same 10 MiB default and message; `CollectStreams` charges the
    same **64-byte** per-entry overhead and does **not** merge consecutive
    same-stream fragments (unlike Rust in-process
    `PrintWriter::CollectStreams`), so it charges one per fragment. Output entries are `{ stream, text }` objects
    rather than Python tuples. The cap is a **logical UTF-8 charge**, not a hard
    V8/host-RSS bound: JS stores strings as UTF-16, so host RSS can exceed the
    stated cap.
- `Stdout` / `Disabled` / `Callback` are unchanged; `Callback` hosts can
    already self-limit by returning an error.
