# Resource limits

Monty enforces limits on memory, time, and recursion to keep untrusted code
bounded, and the host that services its suspensions enforces a suspension
count. Memory limits surface to the host as `MemoryError`s, time limits as
`TimeoutError`s and the suspension limit as a `RuntimeError`; sandboxed code
cannot catch any of these. `RecursionError` is catchable, as in CPython.

## Compilation

`max_duration` starts when the VM executes, so parsing, preparation, and
bytecode compilation do not consume it. In workers, allocations retained by
compiled code do count toward `max_memory`; transient compilation allocations
are released before execution reaches its first memory checkpoint.
Compilation has separate structural caps for parser nesting, bytecode operand
sizes, comprehension nesting, and repeated `finally` expansion. A code object
requiring more than 1,024 emitted copies of `finally` bodies is rejected with
`SyntaxError`; CPython has no equivalent limit. Production hosts should still
isolate compilation when accepting untrusted source, as the subprocess and
WebAssembly runtimes do.

## Memory / size limits

- Memory usage is measured by the worker's process-global allocator, while the
  configured budget belongs to one session.
- Workers count bytes requested from their global allocator. Direct Rust users
  must install `monty-alloc` as the global allocator and arm it with
  `set_limit` before using `max_memory`; without it usage always reads as
  zero and the limit is silently not enforced.
- Operations whose result is bounded by simple arithmetic on input sizes
  are **pre-checked** before allocating: integer multiplication, left
  shift, integer power, sequence repeat (`'x' * n`), replacement
  (`str.replace`, `bytes.replace`), padding (`str.ljust`, `str.center`,
  `str.zfill`, `bytes.ljust`, …), and f-string formatting
  (both dynamic width `f"{v:>{w}}"` and dynamic precision on float
  formats `f"{v:.{p}f}"` / `e` / `%`). The pre-check threshold is 100 KB:
  estimates above that are checked against the remaining budget and rejected
  with `MemoryError` before allocation when they would exceed it.
- `bigint.pow(base, exp)` estimates result size as `bits(base) * exp` with
  a 4× safety multiplier to cover repeated-squaring intermediate values.

## Exceeding `max_memory` in a worker (pools)

A worker counts every byte requested from its global allocator. Nothing extra is
enabled by the host: setting `max_memory` on a session applies it, and a session
without one is unlimited.

- **The configured limit is soft.** The interpreter reads current allocator
  usage at execution checkpoints and reports a terminal `MemoryError` to the
  host after crossing it. The incomplete operation is unwound and the worker
  and session survive, although sandboxed Python cannot catch resource errors.
- **A burst can still kill the worker.** A hard ceiling sits above the configured
  limit so exception and traceback machinery can run. Crossing that ceiling
  between checkpoints exits the subprocess with its dedicated OOM status, or
  traps wasm. The pool replaces the worker and the session is lost. Large
  result operations are pre-checked to avoid this path when their size is known.
- **Work outside Python execution is hard-limit-only.** Request framing, input
  decoding, loading snapshots, and type checking do not reach an interpreter
  checkpoint. A sufficiently large allocation there can cross the hard ceiling
  and kill the worker.
- **A value crossing to the host needs room for about three copies of itself.**
  Returning a result, or passing an argument to a host function, holds the
  sandbox value, its converted host-side form, and the encoded frame at once.
  The effective ceiling for a single such value is therefore around a third of
  `max_memory`, not all of it — well under the limit for ordinary payloads, but
  a multi-MiB argument under a tight budget can cross the hard ceiling while
  announcing the call.
- **It binds the worker's allocator, not the process.** Only bytes requested
  from Rust's global allocator are counted, which is everything sandboxed code
  can cause to be allocated, but not memory obtained another way: thread stacks,
  the binary's own mapped image, or a direct `mmap`. It is not a kernel-enforced
  bound on process memory. An inherited `ulimit -v` or cgroup limit is the tool
  for that, and still applies independently: a worker whose allocation the
  kernel then refuses reports the same `MemoryError`.
- **It counts requested bytes, not resident ones.** Per-allocation overhead and
  fragmentation sit between the count and the process's real footprint, so RSS
  runs somewhat above the limit.
- **`max_memory` alone does not bound worker memory.** The hard ceiling includes
  the worker's baseline plus a fixed gap above the soft limit: a few MiB, more
  with type checking. Use `max_processes` and an OS-level limit to bound a host.
- **Per session, but against a fixed baseline.** A worker serves many checkouts
  and re-derives the cap for each session, always from the leanest the process
  has been. Memory retained between sessions therefore consumes the headroom
  rather than raising the cap, and a worker whose residue outgrows it is killed
  and replaced rather than allowed to grow indefinitely.
- **Restoring a dump is bounded by the checkout it lands in.** `load_session` /
  `load_snapshot` restore the dump's own limits (see
  ./pool-architecture.md), and the cap is re-derived from
  them once the session exists, but the load *itself* runs under the limit the
  `checkout()` config applied. Restoring a large dump into a checkout with a
  much smaller `max_memory` can therefore exceed it while loading; pass a
  comparable limit to `checkout()`.
- **The wasm worker cannot classify a hard breach.** A soft breach is a normal
  `MemoryError`, but exceeding the hard limit traps the instance and the host
  reports `MontyCrashedError`. Its `usize` is also 32 bits, so a limit near
  4 GiB leaves the module uncapped.
- WebSocket workers get no allocator-enforced limit at all: they are remote
  processes this pool does not spawn.

Independently of any limit, **any** allocation a worker's allocator refuses —
plain host OOM, or a request beyond the usable address space such as
`' ' * (1 << 60)` — takes this same path: on a worker with an exit status the
host sees that `MemoryError` with its session gone, and on wasm the same
refusal traps, reported as `MontyCrashedError` per the bullet above. CPython
raises a catchable `MemoryError` in-process and carries on. Monty cannot: the
failure happens below the interpreter, where no Python-level exception can be
raised, so the worker classifies the failure into a dedicated exit code and
dies. Without that, the process would abort with `SIGABRT`, which is
indistinguishable from a stack overflow.

## Integer-specific caps

- `pow(base, exp)` / `base ** exp` with an exponent larger than `u32::MAX`
  (≈ 4.3 × 10⁹) raises `OverflowError: "exponent too large"`.
- `pow(base, exp, mod)` requires all integer arguments and rejects negative
  exponents (`ValueError`).
- `int(str_or_bytes, base)` rejects inputs over 4,300 digits before the
  potentially quadratic BigInt parse when the effective base is not a power
  of two. The fixed cap matches CPython's
  `sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits`.

## Recursion

- Python-level call depth defaults to **1000 frames**; the 1001st nested call
  raises `RecursionError`. The host sets the ceiling per session via
  `max_recursion_depth`, but cannot remove it — unlike the time and memory
  limits, it has no "disabled" state.
- Production sandbox code cannot change the recursion limit. Test builds may
  expose `sys.setrecursionlimit()` as a lowering-only fixture hook; it cannot
  raise the host-configured ceiling.
- Async stacks count toward the limit but each `await` boundary is treated
  as one frame, so `await`-chains do not amplify depth.
- Callbacks evaluated synchronously by the interpreter itself re-enter on the
  native Rust call stack rather than the heap-allocated frame stack used by
  ordinary function calls. This includes `map()`, `filter()`,
  `sorted()`/`list.sort(key=...)`, `min()`/`max(key=...)`, recursive
  `__repr__`/`__str__`, non-plain-function `__init__` values that recurse
  during construction, and calling a `functools.partial`. Native re-entry is
  capped independently at a lower fixed depth than the 1000-frame Python
  limit, so Monty raises `RecursionError` before a native stack overflow would
  abort the process. See the `__repr__`/`__str__` entry in ./classes.md for
  the main user-visible divergence this causes.

## Suspensions

- `max_suspensions` bounds how many times a session may suspend to the host:
  external function calls, host-object method calls, attribute lookups and
  construction, OS calls, name lookups, and each `ResolveFutures` round trip
  (a partial future resolution that re-suspends counts again).
- It is enforced by the host that answers suspensions — `monty-pool` (so
  `pydantic_monty`, the JavaScript napi pool and monty-server), the wasm
  worker pool and the CLI — not by the interpreter. A host driving `monty`
  directly must count for itself and end the feed with `abort`.
- The suspension past the budget is never handed to the caller: the host
  ends the feed with `RuntimeError: suspension limit exceeded: N+1 > N`,
  raised uncatchably at the suspension point with a traceback, at the cost of
  one more round trip to the worker.
- The count is per checkout and is never reset, so once spent every later
  feed is ended on its first suspension. Feeds that do not suspend still run,
  the heap stays consistent (the abort unwinds like any unhandled exception)
  and the session can still be dumped.
- The count does not travel in dumps; only the limit does. A session
  restored from a dump keeps the dump's `max_suspensions` but starts
  counting from zero.
- There is no in-sandbox way to observe the budget or remaining count.

## Time

- The host can set a `max_duration` budget; if exceeded the VM stops with a
  `ResourceError` at its next checkpoint.
- Enforcement is polled, not preemptive: a single bytecode instruction may
  run a long native operation (a `bytes` substring scan, a sort, an iterator
  drain), and those poll the clock at a coarse granularity. A run can
  therefore overshoot `max_duration` before stopping.
- Checkpoints are amortized rather than per-instruction: the dispatch loop
  reads the clock every 256th instruction, and the native loops that poll for
  themselves (iterator advancement, sequence repeats, comparisons, `repr`)
  do so every 64th item. Both are unconditional overshoots of ordinary
  `max_duration` enforcement, on top of the per-operation cases below.
- Every host turn re-checks both limits as it returns, so a turn that
  finished without reaching a checkpoint still fails rather than returning
  its result. Two consequences: a turn whose Python code raised an exception
  reports the resource error instead of that exception, and an operation
  that swallows a timeout internally (`repr` truncating with `...[timeout]`)
  still fails the turn that contained it.
- `bytes` operations that search for a sub-sequence (`in` with a bytes-like
  probe, `find`, `count`, `split`, `partition`, `replace` and their
  variants) poll the clock every 64KiB, or every two lengths of the
  searched-for sequence if that is longer. Searching for a
  sequence over 64KiB therefore overshoots `max_duration` in proportion to
  its length.
- The neighbouring `bytes` operations that scan without a sub-sequence are
  **not** polled and run to completion however large the input: `in` with an
  integer probe (a single-byte scan) and `split()`/`rsplit()` left to their
  default `sep=None` (whitespace splitting).
- The budget covers cumulative **execution time**, not wall-clock time:
  the clock runs only while the interpreter executes bytecode, and is
  paused while execution is suspended waiting on the host (external
  function calls, OS callbacks) and between REPL feeds. It accumulates
  across feeds for the life of the session.
- The accumulated time is serialized into dumps/snapshots, so a restored
  session resumes its budget where it left off rather than restarting
  from zero.
- There is no in-sandbox way to observe the budget or remaining time.

## JSON

- `json.loads` rejects input nested deeper than 200 levels with
  `json.JSONDecodeError` (independent of the Python recursion limit).

## After a terminal resource error

A worker remains responsive after a soft memory or time limit and its session
can receive another feed, but execution is not transactional and no guarantees
are made about heap state or reference counts. Hosts should discard the session;
the worker itself remains reusable. A caught `RecursionError` may continue
normally inside the sandbox.
