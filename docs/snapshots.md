# Snapshots

Monty can pause mid-execution, serialize the whole interpreter to bytes, and resume it later — in another process, or on
another machine.

It works because the sandbox holds no operating system resources.
There are no live file descriptors, no sockets and no threads to reconstruct: when execution suspends, everything that
matters is in the interpreter's own heap.

## Two things you can snapshot

|                  | Taken when                     | Restored with   | Contains                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Session dump** | between feeds, nothing running | `load_session`  | globals, functions, classes, time budget     |
| **Snapshot**     | mid-feed, at a suspension      | `load_snapshot` | all of the above, plus the paused call stack |

Both come from `dump()` and are opaque bytes.
Using the wrong loader for a dump's kind raises, and both loaders are valid only on a fresh session, before any feed.

## Snapshot trust

Only restore unmodified snapshots from a trusted, compatible Monty producer.
The caller must establish provenance and integrity before loading; Monty does not authenticate snapshots or fully
validate their contents.
Invalid snapshots have no correctness or availability guarantees.
Use trusted storage or verify a MAC/signature before restoring bytes received through an untrusted channel.
See [snapshot security](security.md#deserializing-snapshots) for the trust boundary, including direct Rust deserialization.

## Pausing at suspensions

`feed_start` is the suspendable counterpart of `feed_run`.
Instead of driving a snippet to completion it hands control back at every suspension:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete

    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            snapshot = session.feed_start('greet(name) + "!"', inputs={'name': 'Ada'})
            assert isinstance(snapshot, FunctionSnapshot)
            print(snapshot.function_name, snapshot.args)
            #> greet ('Ada',)
            result = snapshot.resume({'return_value': 'hello Ada'})
            assert isinstance(result, MontyComplete)
            print(result.output)
            #> hello Ada!
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete } from '@pydantic/monty'

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout()
    const snapshot = await session.feedStart('greet(name) + "!"', { inputs: { name: 'Ada' } })
    if (!(snapshot instanceof FunctionSnapshot)) throw new Error('expected a function call')
    console.log(snapshot.functionName, snapshot.args) // greet [ 'Ada' ]
    const result = await snapshot.resume('hello Ada')
    if (!(result instanceof MontyComplete)) throw new Error('expected completion')
    console.log(result.output) // hello Ada!
    ```

### The snapshot kinds

| Kind                                                      | Why execution stopped                                                                                                                      | Resume with                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`FunctionSnapshot`][pydantic_monty.FunctionSnapshot]     | A host function or OS call, or with `object_id` set a method call on a [host object](host-objects.md) (construction arrives as `__call__`) | `resume(result)`, `resume_not_handled()`, `resume_auto()`                                                        |
| [`NameLookupSnapshot`][pydantic_monty.NameLookupSnapshot] | An undefined name was read, or with `object_id` set a lazy attribute of a host object                                                      | `resume(value=...)`, `resume()` to raise `NameError` (`AttributeError` when `object_id` is set), `resume_auto()` |
| [`FutureSnapshot`][pydantic_monty.FutureSnapshot]         | Every sandbox task is blocked on host futures                                                                                              | `resume({call_id: result})`                                                                                      |
| [`MontyComplete`][pydantic_monty.MontyComplete]           | Nothing — the snippet finished                                                                                                             | nothing; read `.output`                                                                                          |

[`FunctionSnapshot.resume`][pydantic_monty.FunctionSnapshot.resume] accepts four shapes of answer:

- `{'return_value': value}` — the call returned this.
- `{'exception': ValueError('...')}` — the call raised this exception instance.
- `{'exc_type': 'ValueError', 'message': '...'}` — the call raised this exception, named by type.
    Useful when you do not have the original exception object, for example when resuming a snapshot that was created
    elsewhere.
- `{'future': ...}` — the call returns a pending future the sandbox can `await`; settle it later at the resulting
    `FutureSnapshot`.

In JavaScript those are separate methods: `resume(value)`, `resumeError(err)` and `resumeFuture()`.
For a `NameLookupSnapshot`, use `resumeValue(value)` to answer a variable or lazy attribute read;
`resume(name)` resolves an external function, and `resume()` leaves the lookup unresolved.
Both call and lookup snapshots carry `objectId`, the `ClassInstance.id` or `ClassType.id` of the wrapper involved,
or `null` for plain host calls and name lookups.
It is a wrapper UUID, not a memory address; routing uses the session's instance store, but the UUID can be reused across sessions.

### Where execution stopped

Every snapshot carries `position`, a [`SourceRange`][pydantic_monty.SourceRange] locating the expression that
suspended: the call of a `FunctionSnapshot`, the name of a `NameLookupSnapshot`, and the `await` the main task is
blocked on for a `FutureSnapshot`.
`start` and `end` are UTF-8 byte offsets into the source, `end` exclusive, so slice the encoded source rather than
the string.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import FunctionSnapshot, Monty

    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            code = 'x = 1\ny = greet(x)'
            snapshot = session.feed_start(code)
            assert isinstance(snapshot, FunctionSnapshot)
            position = snapshot.position
            print(position.start, position.end)
            #> 10 18
            print(code.encode()[position.start : position.end].decode())
            #> greet(x)
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { FunctionSnapshot, Monty } from '@pydantic/monty'

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout()
    const code = 'x = 1\ny = greet(x)'
    const snapshot = await session.feedStart(code)
    if (!(snapshot instanceof FunctionSnapshot)) throw new Error('expected a function call')
    const { start, end } = snapshot.position // { filename: '<python-input-0>', start: 10, end: 18 }
    console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(new TextEncoder().encode(code).subarray(start, end))) // 'greet(x)'
    ```

`filename` names the source the range indexes the way a traceback frame does: `<python-input-N>` for the session's
N-th feed, so a suspension inside a function defined by an earlier feed points into that feed, and `<string>` inside an
`eval()` / `exec()` string.
The position is part of the suspended state, so a restored snapshot reports the same one.
A worker that predates the field (an older `monty` binary or server) reports none, and the snapshot then carries an
empty `filename` with both offsets 0.

A snapshot refers to the worker's current suspension; it does not own an independent copy of the execution state.
Only one suspension is live per session.
Resuming twice or feeding while suspended raises `RuntimeError` in Python.
JavaScript throws `Error` for a second resume and `ProtocolError` when feeding while suspended.
To branch execution, dump the snapshot and restore it into separate sessions.

### Tracing manual handlers

Python snapshots expose [`trace_context()`][pydantic_monty.FunctionSnapshot.trace_context]; JavaScript snapshots expose
`traceContext()`.
Both return a standard OpenTelemetry `Context`, preserving baggage and other entries captured at feed/load entry and
replacing its span with the suspension's span when Monty tracing is enabled.
The returned context does not depend on which thread or task later calls the method.
Without Monty tracing, including on Browser/WASM, the methods return the captured context unchanged.
If JavaScript context composition fails, `traceContext()` returns the captured context and reports the error through
OpenTelemetry's `diag.warn`; disabled tracing does not produce a warning.
Python's method requires `opentelemetry-api` and raises `ImportError` if it is not installed.

Activate the returned context through OTel to nest host tracing under the suspension:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from opentelemetry import context

    from pydantic_monty import FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete

    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            snapshot = session.feed_start('greet(name)', inputs={'name': 'Ada'})
            assert isinstance(snapshot, FunctionSnapshot)
            token = context.attach(snapshot.trace_context())
            try:
                greeting = f'hello {snapshot.args[0]}'
            finally:
                context.detach(token)
            result = snapshot.resume({'return_value': greeting})
            assert isinstance(result, MontyComplete)
            print(result.output)
            #> hello Ada
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { context } from '@opentelemetry/api'
    import { FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete } from '@pydantic/monty'

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout()
    const snapshot = await session.feedStart('greet(name)', { inputs: { name: 'Ada' } })
    if (!(snapshot instanceof FunctionSnapshot)) throw new Error('expected a function call')
    const result = await context.with(snapshot.traceContext(), async () => `hello ${snapshot.args[0]}`)
    const done = await snapshot.resume(result)
    if (!(done instanceof MontyComplete)) throw new Error('expected completion')
    console.log(done.output) // hello Ada
    ```

Python's `attach` / `detach` must run in the same thread or async task; an `await` between them is supported.
JavaScript requires an SDK-configured context manager to propagate context across awaits.
The methods do not activate the context or resume execution.
Calling them after resume raises; contexts retrieved earlier remain usable but do not keep the suspension span open.
Context is not serialized: restoring captures the restoring caller's context instead.
`resume_auto()` / `resumeAuto()` already activate the suspension span around callbacks.

### Driving automatically

To iterate to completion without answering each suspension by hand, pass an `external_lookup` (and an `os=` handler if
you need one) to `feed_start` and drive with `resume_auto()`.
It resolves each suspension the same way `feed_run` would, one step at a time, so you can inspect or `dump()` each one
along the way:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyComplete

    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            snapshot = session.feed_start(
                'greet(name) + "!"',
                inputs={'name': 'Ada'},
                external_lookup={'greet': lambda n: f'hello {n}'},
            )
            while not isinstance(snapshot, MontyComplete):
                snapshot = snapshot.resume_auto()
            print(snapshot.output)
            #> hello Ada!
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { Monty, MontyComplete } from '@pydantic/monty'

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout()
    let snapshot = await session.feedStart('greet(name) + "!"', {
      inputs: { name: 'Ada' },
      externalLookup: { greet: (n: string) => `hello ${n}` },
    })
    while (!(snapshot instanceof MontyComplete)) {
      snapshot = await snapshot.resumeAuto()
    }
    console.log(snapshot.output) // hello Ada!
    ```

`external_lookup`, `os` and mounts are fixed for the feed and used only by `resume_auto()`.
`feed_start` still returns each suspension; plain `resume(...)` answers it without consulting those handlers.

## Storing and restoring

`snapshot.dump()` serializes the paused worker.
If the serialized state exceeds the 256 MiB message cap, `dump()` raises `RuntimeError` without changing the session;
a suspended session remains resumable.
A fresh session's `load_snapshot` restores it and returns the snapshot to resume:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete

    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            snapshot = session.feed_start(
                'fetch(url)', inputs={'url': 'https://example.com'}
            )
            blob = snapshot.dump()

        # later — restore into a fresh session and resume
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            snapshot = session.load_snapshot(blob)
            assert isinstance(snapshot, FunctionSnapshot)
            result = snapshot.resume({'return_value': 'page contents'})
            assert isinstance(result, MontyComplete)
            print(result.output)
            #> page contents
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete } from '@pydantic/monty'

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    let blob: Buffer
    {
      await using session = await pool.checkout()
      const snapshot = await session.feedStart('fetch(url)', { inputs: { url: 'https://example.com' } })
      if (!(snapshot instanceof FunctionSnapshot)) throw new Error('expected a function call')
      blob = await snapshot.dump()
    }

    // later — restore into a fresh session and resume
    {
      await using session = await pool.checkout()
      const snapshot = await session.loadSnapshot(blob)
      if (!(snapshot instanceof FunctionSnapshot)) throw new Error('expected a function call')
      const result = await snapshot.resume('page contents')
      if (!(result instanceof MontyComplete)) throw new Error('expected completion')
      console.log(result.output) // page contents
    }
    ```

`session.dump()` between feeds serializes an idle session instead; restore it with `session.load_session(blob)` and keep
feeding:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import Monty

    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            session.feed_run('x = 40')
            blob = session.dump()

        with pool.checkout() as session:
            session.load_session(blob)
            print(session.feed_run('x + 2'))
            #> 42
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { Monty } from '@pydantic/monty'

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    let blob: Buffer
    {
      await using session = await pool.checkout()
      await session.feedRun('x = 40')
      blob = await session.dump()
    }

    {
      await using session = await pool.checkout()
      await session.loadSession(blob)
      console.log(await session.feedRun('x + 2')) // 42
    }
    ```

Once restoration is attempted, a failure, including using the wrong loader for a dump's kind, discards the worker.
Check out a fresh session rather than retrying on the failed one.
Calling a loader after a feed or a previous load is rejected before restoration, leaving the existing session usable.

## What restoring does and does not carry

- **The dump carries its own configuration.** `script_name`, resource limits and type-check state come from the dump,
    not from the `checkout()` that restored it.
- **The instance store does not travel.** Host objects sent before the dump are unknown to the restored session: they
    come back as [`MontyClassProxy`][pydantic_monty.MontyClassProxy] (a host class, `type(x)` included, as [`MontyClassTypeProxy`][pydantic_monty.MontyClassTypeProxy] in Python and as a plain
    `{ __monty_type__: 'Type', ... }` marker in JavaScript), method calls on them
    raise `RuntimeError`, lazy attributes raise `AttributeError`, and [`ClassType`][pydantic_monty.ClassType] construction raises `RuntimeError`.
    See [host objects](host-objects.md#snapshots).
- **The accumulated time budget travels with the dump**, so a restored session resumes where it left off rather than
    getting a fresh budget.
- **Only the suspension limit travels.** A restored session keeps `max_suspensions`, but the pool resets its count to
    zero, and a `max_suspensions` set on the restoring `checkout()` caps the dump's.
- **Mounts do not travel.** Host paths are never part of a dump.
    Pass the same `mount=` to `load_snapshot`; Monty cannot check whether mounts were omitted or changed.
    Uncovered calls fall through to `os=` or the sandbox's no-handler error.
    A dump suspended on an OS call re-announces that call, so a newly supplied mount can answer it.
    Any `'overlay'` writes made before the dump are gone — the restored overlay starts empty.
- **A restored [`FutureSnapshot`][pydantic_monty.FutureSnapshot] cannot be driven with `resume_auto()`.** Its pending coroutines lived in the previous
    process.
    Resolve them by hand with `resume({call_id: ...})`.
- **A dump is your own session state, not untrusted input.** Loading checks the magic, the version, the size cap and the
    structural invariants the interpreter relies on (function metadata, for one), but it is not a security boundary:
    load only dumps this host produced.
- **Dumps carry a format version.** The bytes are Monty's own dump format, a `MONTY\0` magic followed by a dump-format
    version, then the state encoded as CBOR with every field and variant named.
    A release that only changes the layout of stored data, adding fields that default when absent or removing and
    reordering named fields, keeps the version, so its builds still load dumps written by earlier releases at that
    version.
    A release that changes what stored data means, such as the bytecode, bumps the version and says so in its release
    notes; a build then refuses dumps from before the bump as too old, and the session has to be rebuilt by replaying
    its feeds.
    The same bytes load in-process, in a subprocess and over WebSocket.

## Async

[`AsyncMonty`][pydantic_monty.AsyncMonty] sessions expose the same `feed_start`, `load_session`, `load_snapshot` and `dump`, with awaitable
`resume(...)` and `resume_auto()`.
A coroutine host function, or a coroutine answer to `asyncio.sleep()` under `os_policy={'sleep': 'call_host'}`, is awaited directly by `resume_auto()` when the
snapshot's `allow_eager_await` is true,
which it is for a call that is awaited immediately while no other sandbox task can run and no external future is pending.
Otherwise it is awaited concurrently: `resume_auto()` yields an [`AsyncFutureSnapshot`][pydantic_monty.AsyncFutureSnapshot] whose
`resume_auto()` settles the pending coroutines.

The sync [`FutureSnapshot.resume_auto()`][pydantic_monty.FutureSnapshot.resume_auto] always raises — a sync session cannot drive coroutine host functions.

## Rust

In Rust the in-process API serializes through the free function `monty::dump`, which takes an idle or suspended session
by reference, and [`Dump::load`](api/rust/monty.md#dump), which returns the session plus its script name and type-check state.
Through `monty-pool` it is [`Checkout::dump`](api/rust/monty-pool.md#checkout) and [`Checkout::restore`](api/rust/monty-pool.md#checkout).
See the [Rust quickstart](quickstart/rust.md#serialization).

## Uses

- **Long-running agents.** Suspend at a tool call, persist the blob, resume when the tool answers, possibly on a
    different host.
- **Approval gates.** Pause at a sensitive call, store the snapshot, resume once a human approves.
- **Forking.** One snapshot restored into several sessions explores several branches from the same state.
- **Surviving restarts.** A remote server draining for deploy answers with a dump you can restore elsewhere.
    A server that stores sessions instead resumes them for you; see
    [stored sessions](api/python/websocket.md#stored-sessions).
