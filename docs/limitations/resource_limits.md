# Resource limits

Monty limits memory, time, sleep and recursion, while the host limits suspension
events. Exceeding the memory, time, or suspension limit returns `MemoryError`,
`TimeoutError`, or `RuntimeError`, respectively; sandboxed code cannot catch
these exceptions. `RecursionError` is catchable, as in CPython.

## Compilation

The duration limits start when the VM executes, so parsing, preparation, and
bytecode compilation do not consume them. In workers, allocations retained by
compiled code do count toward `max_memory`; transient compilation allocations
are released before execution reaches its first memory checkpoint.
Compilation has separate structural caps for parser nesting, bytecode operand
sizes, comprehension nesting, and repeated `finally` expansion. The parser
grows its native stack outside the sandbox allocator, so a source over 4 KiB is
scanned for nesting before it is parsed (see [language.md](language.md)). A code object
requiring more than 1,024 emitted copies of `finally` bodies is rejected with
`SyntaxError`; CPython has no equivalent limit. Production hosts should still
isolate compilation when accepting untrusted source, as the subprocess and
WebAssembly runtimes do.

Code compiled at runtime by `eval()` / `exec()` is the exception: it is parsed and compiled inside the VM,
so that work is charged against `max_feed_duration` and `max_turn_duration`.
Once a snippet starts executing, its source and bytecode stay allocated for the rest of the session.
Snippets rejected before execution retain none of their compilation products (see [eval_exec.md](eval_exec.md)).

## Memory / size limits

- Memory usage is measured by the worker's process-global allocator, while the
    configured budget belongs to one session.
- Workers count bytes requested from their global allocator. Direct Rust users
    must install `monty-alloc` as the global allocator and arm its hard ceiling
    with `set_hard_limit(memory_limit_with_headroom(...))` before using
    `max_memory`; without it usage always reads as zero and the limit is silently
    not enforced.
- Operations whose result is bounded by simple arithmetic on input sizes
    are **pre-checked** before allocating: integer multiplication, left
    shift, integer power, sequence repeat (`'x' * n`), replacement
    (`str.replace`, `bytes.replace`), `re.sub`, padding (`str.ljust`, `str.center`,
    `str.zfill`, `bytes.ljust`, …), integer division and `divmod`,
    `math.factorial`, `math.comb` and `math.perm`, deque
    rotation, slicing and repeat, materialising an iterator into a
    container, and string formatting with dynamic width or precision, for
    f-strings (`f"{v:>{w}}"`, `f"{v:.{p}f}"`), `str.format()`
    (`"{0:>{1}}".format(v, w)`, `"{0:.{1}f}".format(v, p)`) and `%`
    formatting (`"%*d" % (w, v)`, `"%.*f" % (p, v)`). The pre-check
    threshold is 100 KB:
    estimates above that are checked against the remaining budget and rejected
    with `MemoryError` before allocation when they would exceed it.
- `bigint.pow(base, exp)` estimates result size as `bits(base) * exp` with
    a 4× safety multiplier to cover repeated-squaring intermediate values.

## Exceeding `max_memory` in a worker (pools)

A worker counts every byte requested from its global allocator. Nothing extra is
enabled by the host: setting `max_memory` on a session applies it, and a session
without one is unlimited.

- **The configured limit is soft.** The interpreter reads current allocator
    usage at execution checkpoints and reports a terminal `MemoryError` to the
    host after crossing it. The incomplete operation is unwound and the worker
    and session survive, although sandboxed Python cannot catch resource errors.
- **A burst can still kill the worker.** A hard ceiling sits above the configured
    limit so exception and traceback machinery can run. Crossing that ceiling
    between checkpoints exits the subprocess with its dedicated OOM status, or
    traps wasm. The pool replaces the worker and the session is lost. Large
    result operations are pre-checked to avoid this path when their size is known,
    as is buffer growth a program drives one element at a time — `append`,
    `insert`, `add` or `d[k] = v` on a list, deque, set or dict, a parsed JSON
    array — and the argument buffers behind `f(*args)` and the pieces `re.split`
    collects.
    `re.findall` is covered only for a pattern with at most one capture group.
    A wider `findall` builds a tuple per match, and `re.finditer` a match object,
    and those accumulate between the checks on the result list itself, so a
    large enough subject still crosses the ceiling and kills the worker.
- **Work outside Python execution is hard-limit-only.** Request framing, input
    decoding, loading snapshots, and type checking do not reach an interpreter
    checkpoint. A sufficiently large allocation there can cross the hard ceiling
    and kill the worker.
- **A value crossing to the host needs room for about three copies of itself.**
    Returning a result, or passing an argument to a host function, holds the
    sandbox value, its converted host-side form, and the encoded frame at once.
    The effective ceiling for a single such value is therefore around a third of
    `max_memory`, not all of it — well under the limit for ordinary payloads, but
    a multi-MiB argument under a tight budget can cross the hard ceiling while
    announcing the call.
- **It binds the worker's allocator, not the process.** Only bytes requested
    from Rust's global allocator are counted, which is everything sandboxed code
    can cause to be allocated, but not memory obtained another way: thread stacks,
    the binary's own mapped image, or a direct `mmap`. It is not a kernel-enforced
    bound on process memory. An inherited `ulimit -v` or cgroup limit is the tool
    for that, and still applies independently: a worker whose allocation the
    kernel then refuses reports the same `MemoryError`.
- **It counts requested bytes, not resident ones.** Per-allocation overhead and
    fragmentation sit between the count and the process's real footprint, so RSS
    runs somewhat above the limit.
- **`max_memory` alone does not bound worker memory.** The hard ceiling includes
    the worker's baseline plus a fixed gap above the soft limit: a few MiB, more
    with type checking. Use `max_processes` and an OS-level limit to bound a host.
- **Per session, but against a fixed baseline.** A worker serves many checkouts
    and re-derives the cap for each session, always from the leanest the process
    has been, plus the type checker once a session has needed it.
    Other memory retained between sessions therefore consumes the headroom
    rather than raising the cap, and a worker whose residue outgrows it is killed
    and replaced rather than allowed to grow indefinitely.
- **Restoring a dump is bounded by the checkout it lands in.** `load_session` /
    `load_snapshot` restore the dump's own limits (see
    [snapshot configuration](../snapshots.md#what-restoring-does-and-does-not-carry)), and the cap is re-derived from
    them once the session exists, but the load *itself* runs under the limit the
    `checkout()` config applied. Restoring a large dump into a checkout with a
    much smaller `max_memory` can therefore exceed it while loading; pass a
    comparable limit to `checkout()`.
- **The wasm worker cannot classify a hard breach.** A soft breach is a normal
    `MemoryError`, but exceeding the hard limit traps the instance and the host
    reports [`MontyCrashedError`][pydantic_monty.MontyCrashedError]. Its `usize` is also 32 bits, so a limit near
    4 GiB leaves the module uncapped.
- WebSocket workers get no allocator-enforced limit at all: they are remote
    processes this pool does not spawn.

Independently of any limit, **any** allocation a worker's allocator refuses —
plain host OOM, or a request beyond the usable address space such as
`' ' * (1 << 60)` — takes this same path: on a worker with an exit status the
host sees that `MemoryError` with its session gone, and on wasm the same
refusal traps, reported as `MontyCrashedError` per the bullet above. CPython
raises a catchable `MemoryError` in-process and carries on. Monty cannot: the
failure happens below the interpreter, where no Python-level exception can be
raised, so the worker classifies the failure into a dedicated exit code and
dies. Without that, the process would abort with `SIGABRT`, which is
indistinguishable from a stack overflow.

## Integer-specific caps

- `pow(base, exp)` / `base ** exp` with an exponent larger than `u32::MAX`
    (≈ 4.3 × 10⁹) raises `OverflowError: "exponent too large"`, except for
    bases 0, 1 and -1, which are computed.
- `pow(base, exp, mod)` requires all integer arguments and rejects negative
    exponents (`ValueError`).
    A call whose work estimate (exponent bits × modulus words²) is at most 2²⁷ runs
    to completion without polling the time limit, about 0.2 s on a laptop; larger
    calls poll between exponent bits, so a single squaring of the modulus is the
    longest uninterruptible step.
- `int(str_or_bytes, base)` rejects inputs over 4,300 digits before the
    potentially quadratic BigInt parse when the effective base is not a power
    of two. The fixed cap matches CPython's
    `sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits`.

## Recursion

- Python-level call depth defaults to **1000 frames**; the 1001st nested call
    raises `RecursionError`. The host sets the ceiling per session via
    `max_recursion_depth`, but cannot remove it — unlike the time and memory
    limits, it has no "disabled" state.
- Production sandbox code cannot change the recursion limit. Test builds may
    expose `sys.setrecursionlimit()` as a lowering-only fixture hook; it cannot
    raise the host-configured ceiling.
- Async stacks count toward the limit but each `await` boundary is treated
    as one frame, so `await`-chains do not amplify depth.
- Callbacks evaluated synchronously by the interpreter itself re-enter on the
    native Rust call stack rather than the heap-allocated frame stack used by
    ordinary function calls. This includes `map()`, `filter()`,
    `sorted()`/`list.sort(key=...)`, `min()`/`max(key=...)`, recursive
    `__repr__`/`__str__`, non-plain-function `__init__` values that recurse
    during construction, and calling a `functools.partial`. Native re-entry is
    capped independently at a lower fixed depth than the 1000-frame Python
    limit, so Monty raises `RecursionError` before a native stack overflow would
    abort the process. See the `__repr__`/`__str__` entry in [classes.md](classes.md) for
    the main user-visible divergence this causes.
- Operations that walk a nested container in Rust — `==`, `<`, `repr()`,
    `hash()`, `isinstance()`, `json.dumps()`, `copy.deepcopy()` — charge one
    recursion level per level of nesting, but each level costs real native stack
    (roughly 0.5-1.1 KiB, depending on the operation and the container). They are
    not capped separately the way native re-entry above is, so on a worker with a
    small stack a structure nested close to the 1000-frame limit can exhaust it
    before `RecursionError` is raised. A wasm worker (1 MiB) reaches that point at
    roughly 950 levels of nesting for the most expensive operations; the sandbox
    is not breached, but the worker dies and the pool replaces it rather than the
    session raising. Lowering `max_recursion_depth` moves the point at which the
    limit fires ahead of the stack.

## Suspensions

- `max_suspensions` bounds how many times a session may suspend to the host:
    external function calls, host-object method calls, attribute lookups and
    construction, OS calls, name lookups, and each `ResolveFutures` round trip
    (a partial future resolution that re-suspends counts again).
- It defaults to 1000 and cannot be disabled (like `max_recursion_depth`):
    omitting it, or passing `None`, keeps the default; set a larger number
    for sessions that legitimately make more host calls.
- `monty-pool` enforces it for `pydantic_monty`, the JavaScript napi pool and
    monty-server. The wasm worker pool and CLI also enforce it. A direct host
    must count suspensions and call `abort` itself.
- The first suspension over budget is not returned to the caller. The host
    uses one extra worker round trip to raise
    `RuntimeError: suspension limit N exceeded` uncatchably at the
    suspension point with a traceback.
- The count persists for the checkout. Once spent, every later feed ends on
    its first suspension. Non-suspending feeds still run, the heap stays
    consistent, and the session can still be dumped.
- Only the limit travels in dumps. A restored session keeps
    `max_suspensions` but resets the count to zero; a limit configured on the
    restoring checkout caps the dump's (the smaller of the two applies, and
    the configured one alone if the worker's reply omits it).
- There is no in-sandbox way to observe the budget or remaining count.

## Sleep

- `max_total_sleep` bounds cumulative system sleep durations (see [time.md](time.md)).
    It is disabled by default; sleeping loops remain bounded by `max_suspensions`.
    Bindings expose `max_total_sleep_secs` or `maxTotalSleepSecs`; the CLI uses `--max-total-sleep`.
- Pools and the CLI charge each capped delay before waiting.
    Exceeding the total raises an uncatchable `TimeoutError: sleep limit exceeded: <total> > <limit>`.
    The reported total includes the refused sleep and uses Rust `Duration` formatting, such as `1.5s > 1s`.
    An `asyncio.sleep()` costs its full capped delay when created, regardless of how long the host waits.
    Non-suspending `MontyRun::run` enforces no total sleep limit.
- The time already slept travels in dumps with the limit, like execution time,
    so a restored session resumes its budget rather than restarting from zero.
- Sleeps handed to the host under `'call_host'` are not charged to it.

## Time

- The host can set a `max_feed_duration` or `max_turn_duration` budget; if
    either is exceeded the VM stops with a
    [`ResourceError`](../api/rust/monty-types.md#resourceerror) at its next checkpoint.
    There is no cumulative per-session budget: both clocks restart, so nothing
    inside the sandbox bounds what a session costs over its lifetime.
- When one checkpoint blows both budgets, the feed one is reported. The message
    names the scope — `feed time limit exceeded`, `turn time limit exceeded`.
- Enforcement is polled, not preemptive: a single bytecode instruction may
    run a long native operation (a `bytes` substring scan, a sort, an iterator
    drain), and those poll the clock at a coarse granularity. A run can
    therefore overshoot its budget before stopping.
- Checkpoints are amortized rather than per-instruction: the dispatch loop
    reads the clock every 256th instruction, and the native loops that poll for
    themselves (iterator advancement, sequence repeats, comparisons, `repr`)
    do so every 64th item. Both are unconditional overshoots of ordinary
    time-limit enforcement, on top of the per-operation cases below.
- A container narrower than that 64-item interval never reaches a poll at all.
    Structures that share sub-objects are walked once per path rather than once per
    object, so `repr` and `==` over one nested `n` levels deep do work exponential
    in `n` (`x = (x, x)` repeated, and the same through a generic alias). Neither
    limit is consulted until the walk finishes, and the two end differently: `repr`
    grows a result string until it crosses the allocator's hard ceiling, while `==`
    allocates nothing proportional, so only the pool's `request_timeout` ends it.
    `hash` is unaffected, each tuple caching its own.
- Every host turn re-checks both limits as it returns, so a turn that
    finished without reaching a checkpoint still fails rather than returning
    its result. Two consequences: a turn whose Python code raised an exception
    reports the resource error instead of that exception, and an operation
    that swallows a timeout internally (`repr` truncating with `...[timeout]`)
    still fails the turn that contained it.
- `bytes` operations that search for a sub-sequence (`in` with a bytes-like
    probe, `find`, `count`, `split`, `partition`, `replace` and their
    variants) poll the clock every 64KiB, or every two lengths of the
    searched-for sequence if that is longer. Searching for a
    sequence over 64KiB therefore overshoots its duration budget in proportion to
    its length.
- The neighbouring `bytes` operations that scan without a sub-sequence are
    **not** polled and run to completion however large the input: `in` with an
    integer probe (a single-byte scan) and `split()`/`rsplit()` left to their
    default `sep=None` (whitespace splitting).
- The `str` case methods (`lower`, `upper`, `casefold`, `capitalize`, `title`,
    `swapcase`) and `is*()` predicates are **not** polled and run to completion.
    Their cost is linear in the input, so the overshoot is bounded by the largest
    string `max_memory` admits.
- `base64.a85decode()` polls the clock every 64th byte that matches no
    Ascii85 digit and so reaches `ignorechars`. Each of those bytes is one
    `in` test against the container, so a large explicit `ignorechars`
    overshoots its duration budget in proportion to its length.
- Both budgets cover **execution time**, not wall-clock time: the clock runs
    only while the interpreter executes bytecode, and is paused while execution
    is suspended waiting on the host (external function calls, OS callbacks)
    and between REPL feeds.
- There is no in-sandbox way to observe either budget or the time left in it.
- `max_feed_duration` and `max_turn_duration` bound one clock over two scopes,
    differing only in when it restarts: at each feed, and at each feed or
    answered suspension respectively.
- A feed that the host never resumes leaves its `max_feed_duration` clock
    where it stopped. The next feed resets it, so the abandoned feed's time is
    charged to nothing.
- `MontyRepl::call_function` counts as its own feed *and* its own turn, so a
    host-driven call is never charged for the feeds before it.
- A turn's clock restarts at the resume, not at the point the host answered,
    so it never includes the time the host spent deciding.
- Continuations the VM resolves without the host — an `await` on an
    already-settled future, a task switch — stay inside the turn that started
    them and do not restart the turn clock.
- A name lookup the host answers restarts the turn clock, including one
    answered as `Undefined`: the round trip happened either way.
- `max_feed_duration` is serialized into dumps/snapshots, so a restored session
    resumes the feed budget it was dumped mid-way through; `max_turn_duration`'s
    clock is not, because a dump is only ever taken between turns.

## JSON

- `json.loads` rejects input nested deeper than 200 levels with
    `json.JSONDecodeError` (independent of the Python recursion limit).

## After a terminal resource error

A worker remains responsive after a soft memory or time limit and its session
can receive another feed, but execution is not transactional and no guarantees
are made about heap state or reference counts. Hosts should discard the session;
the worker itself remains reusable. A caught `RecursionError` may continue
normally inside the sandbox.
