# `str.encode()` / `bytes.decode()`

Monty implements a fixed, small set of text codecs rather than the full
`codecs`/`encodings` registry CPython ships. The `str(b, encoding, errors)`
and `bytes(s, encoding, errors)` constructor forms route through the same
registry, so everything below applies to them too.

## Supported codecs

- `utf-8`
- `ascii`
- `utf-16`, `utf-16-le`, `utf-16-be`
- `utf-32`, `utf-32-le`, `utf-32-be`

Names are normalized like CPython (case-insensitive; runs of spaces/hyphens
collapse to `_`) and each codec's CPython aliases are recognized (`utf8`,
`u16`, `646`, `us-ascii`, ...). Any other encoding name raises
`LookupError: unknown encoding: {name}`, including names CPython recognizes
(`latin-1`, `cp1252`, `iso-8859-1`, `big5`, ...).

## Byte order for bare `utf-16` / `utf-32`

CPython's bare `utf-16`/`utf-32` codecs use the *platform's native* byte
order: encode writes a BOM in native order, and BOM-less input decodes as
native order. Monty always uses **little-endian** for both, so behavior is
identical on every little-endian host (all platforms Monty CI covers) but
diverges on big-endian hosts. Input with a BOM decodes identically
everywhere, since the BOM's order wins.

## Error handlers

- **`bytes.decode(..., errors='surrogateescape')` raises
    `NotImplementedError`** when a byte actually needs handling: CPython maps
    undecodable bytes to lone surrogates (U+DC80–U+DCFF), which Monty's
    strict-UTF-8 strings cannot contain.
- **`errors='surrogatepass'` on decode raises `NotImplementedError`** in the
    cases where CPython would produce a lone surrogate (a CESU-8 surrogate
    triple in UTF-8 input; a lone surrogate unit/code point in UTF-16/32
    input). For any other invalid input it re-raises the strict
    `UnicodeDecodeError`, matching CPython.
- Custom handlers registered via `codecs.register_error` do not exist
    (there is no `codecs` module); any name outside CPython's built-in set
    raises `LookupError: unknown error handler name '{name}'`.
- All other built-in handlers behave as in CPython, in both directions.
    `namereplace` output for recently-added code points is subject to the
    Unicode version skew described in [unicodedata.md](unicodedata.md).

## `UnicodeEncodeError` / `UnicodeDecodeError`

**Inside the sandbox** both are message-only, like every other Monty
exception; see [exceptions.md](exceptions.md).
CPython's `encoding`/`object`/`start`/`end`/`reason` attributes are not
exposed to sandboxed code, and the in-sandbox constructor accepts only a
single message argument.

**On the host**, codec errors carry the structured constructor fields, so
`pydantic_monty`'s `.exception()` rebuilds a real `UnicodeDecodeError` /
`UnicodeEncodeError` with all five CPython attributes. The host falls back
to a plain `ValueError` carrying the formatted message (both are caught by
`except ValueError:`) in two cases:

- the failing object is larger than 64 KiB, where the payload is dropped so an
    exception cannot pin a huge input in memory outside the sandbox's
    resource limits (CPython's exception always references the full object);
- the exception was raised manually inside the sandbox
    (`raise UnicodeDecodeError('msg')`), where no structured fields exist.

The structured fields only travel with a *raised* exception that escapes the
sandbox. A codec exception handled as a **value** (caught in the sandbox and
then returned as the run result, or passed to an external function) crosses
the boundary as a message-only exception object, so the host sees the
`ValueError` fallback for it even though the same exception raised out of
the sandbox would rebuild the real type.

The JavaScript package does not reconstruct host-side exception instances,
so this applies to `pydantic_monty` only.
