# Filesystem Access

A Monty sandbox has no filesystem.
With nothing configured, `open()` and every `pathlib.Path` method that reaches the filesystem raise `PermissionError`
for every path, because nothing is exposed for them to reach — including the existence checks CPython answers without
raising.
`/tmp`, `/etc`, `/proc`, `/dev`, `~` and the host working directory are not reachable.

You give the sandbox a filesystem in one of two ways: **mounts**, which map real host directories to virtual paths, or
an **`os` callback**, which answers filesystem operations in host code.

## Mounts

A [`MountDir`][pydantic_monty.MountDir] maps a host directory to a virtual path inside the sandbox.
Mounts are per-feed, and all arguments are keyword-only:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    import tempfile
    from pathlib import Path

    from pydantic_monty import Monty, MountDir

    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
        Path(tmp, 'greeting.txt').write_text('hello from the host')

        code = "from pathlib import Path\nPath('/data/greeting.txt').read_text()"

        with MountDir(host_path=tmp, virtual_path='/data', mode='read-only') as mount:
            with Monty() as pool:
                with pool.checkout() as session:
                    print(session.feed_run(code, mount=mount))
                    #> hello from the host
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { mkdtempSync, rmSync, writeFileSync } from 'node:fs'
    import { tmpdir } from 'node:os'
    import { join } from 'node:path'

    import { Monty } from '@pydantic/monty'
    import { MountDir } from '@pydantic/monty/node'

    const tmp = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), 'monty-'))
    writeFileSync(join(tmp, 'greeting.txt'), 'hello from the host')

    const code = "from pathlib import Path\nPath('/data/greeting.txt').read_text()"

    {
      using mount = new MountDir({ hostPath: tmp, virtualPath: '/data', mode: 'read-only' })
      await using pool = await Monty.create()
      await using session = await pool.checkout()
      console.log(await session.feedRun(code, { mount })) // hello from the host
    }
    rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true })
    ```

Pass a list to `mount=` for several at once.
The mounts of one feed must have distinct virtual paths and cover disjoint host directories; a feed that mounts a
directory and one inside it, the same directory twice, or two directories at one virtual path fails before it starts
with a `MontyRuntimeError` wrapping a `ValueError`, since the stricter mount's mode could otherwise be bypassed through
the other mount's paths.
See [`limitations/filesystem.md`](limitations/filesystem.md#overlapping-mounts-cannot-both-be-registered).
In JavaScript `MountDir` comes from the `@pydantic/monty/node` subpath and `using` closes it at the end of scope; the
WebAssembly build rejects mounts outright, because a browser has no host filesystem.

### Working directory

The sandbox has a virtual working directory.
A session's first feed sets it to the first mount's virtual path, or `/` when nothing is mounted, and it then persists
across the session's feeds like the globals do.
`os.getcwd()` and `Path.cwd()` report it.
Relative paths in `open()`, `os` and `pathlib` calls are joined onto it.
Mounts receive these paths without collapsing `.` or `..`, so they can validate every component.
`__file__` is the script name's final component placed under it.
`os.chdir()` moves it, and the change carries over to later feeds.
Pass `cwd=` to switch to another absolute virtual path before a feed.

Custom `os` callbacks in Python and JavaScript receive normalized absolute paths, with `.` and `..` collapsed.
For example, `os.listdir()` passes `/data` when the cwd is `/data`, and `../secret` becomes `/secret`.
Both rename arguments are normalized.
Check access rules against complete path components: a string prefix check can confuse `/data` with `/database`.
Use `MountTable` for host filesystem access: normalization and prefix checks alone do not confine symlinks or prevent races.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    import tempfile
    from pathlib import Path

    from pydantic_monty import Monty, MountDir

    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
        Path(tmp, 'notes.txt').write_text('hello')

        code = "import os\n(os.getcwd(), __file__, open('notes.txt').read())"

        with MountDir(host_path=tmp, virtual_path='/data', mode='read-only') as mount:
            with Monty() as pool:
                with pool.checkout() as session:
                    print(session.feed_run(code, mount=mount))
                    #> ('/data', '/data/main.py', 'hello')
                    cwd_code = 'import os\nos.getcwd()'
                    print(session.feed_run(cwd_code, mount=mount, cwd='/data/sub'))
                    #> /data/sub
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { mkdtempSync, rmSync, writeFileSync } from 'node:fs'
    import { tmpdir } from 'node:os'
    import { join } from 'node:path'

    import { Monty } from '@pydantic/monty'
    import { MountDir } from '@pydantic/monty/node'

    const tmp = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), 'monty-'))
    writeFileSync(join(tmp, 'notes.txt'), 'hello')

    const code = "import os\n(os.getcwd(), __file__, open('notes.txt').read())"

    {
      using mount = new MountDir({ hostPath: tmp, virtualPath: '/data', mode: 'read-only' })
      await using pool = await Monty.create()
      await using session = await pool.checkout()
      console.log(await session.feedRun(code, { mount })) // [ '/data', '/data/main.py', 'hello' ]
      console.log(await session.feedRun('import os\nos.getcwd()', { mount, cwd: '/data/sub' })) // /data/sub
    }
    rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true })
    ```

The directory is not checked against the mounts, and `os.chdir()` needs a mount (or `os` callback) to confirm its
target exists.
The divergences are in [`limitations/os.md`](limitations/os.md).

### Modes

| Mode                  | Reads                    | Writes                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `'read-only'`         | from the host directory  | raise `PermissionError`                          |
| `'read-write'`        | from the host directory  | written through to the host                      |
| `'overlay'` (default) | fall through to the host | captured in memory, discarded when the feed ends |

`'overlay'` is the default: writes are kept in memory and discarded when the feed ends, and sandboxed code still reads
back its own writes.
Each feed starts with a fresh overlay.

!!! warning "`'read-write'` writes files from untrusted code to your real filesystem"

    Those files are untrusted input; do not execute them.
    Importing counts as executing, and the import can be indirect: with a directory on `sys.path` mounted, sandboxed
    code can write `json.py`, or any module not yet imported, and the host's next `import` runs it — including imports
    `pydantic_monty` makes itself.
    Use `'read-write'` only with a directory that contains no code or config and is not on `sys.path` or any other
    execution path.

### Options

| Argument             | Default       | Meaning                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `host_path`          | required      | Real host directory; canonicalized at construction, raises if missing or not a directory |
| `virtual_path`       | required      | Absolute POSIX-style path prefix inside the sandbox, whatever the host OS                |
| `mode`               | `'overlay'`   | One of the three above                                                                   |
| `write_bytes_limit`  | `None`        | Cap on bytes written through the mount per feed; exceeding it raises `OSError`           |
| `memory_usage_limit` | `100_000_000` | Byte budget for overlay data and transient results; exceeding it raises `MemoryError`    |

Validation happens at construction, not at feed time — a bad `virtual_path` raises immediately.
Mounts are serviced by the host, including for remote workers; the worker never receives host paths.
Closing a mount prevents new feeds from using it, but an in-flight feed keeps its own reference.

The names are keyword-only on purpose: mount tools disagree on whether host or virtual comes first (`docker -v` versus
nginx's `alias`), so requiring names removes the ambiguity.

### What a mount guarantees

Confinement is structural, not a check.
Each mount opens a directory descriptor (`cap_std::fs::Dir`) once, at mount time, and every operation runs relative to
that descriptor, so `..`, symlinks and directories swapped mid-operation cannot reach outside it.
`..` and `.` are collapsed in the virtual namespace before anything touches the filesystem, null bytes are rejected, and
paths handed back to the sandbox (from `Path.resolve()`, for example) are virtual paths — a host path never leaks in.
See the [security model](security.md#mounts-and-the-os-callback).

The cost of the structural boundary is symlink support: read-only and read-write mounts refuse a symlink with an
absolute target even when it points back inside the mount, and overlay mounts refuse symlinks entirely.
Relative symlinks that stay inside the mount are followed in the non-overlay modes.

### Things that differ from CPython

- **Virtual paths are always POSIX**, on every host OS.
    `Path('C:/Users/foo')` is a literal POSIX path, and `repr` is always `PosixPath(...)`.
- **No live file descriptors.** `open()` keeps no OS handle between calls; each read or write is a separate one-shot
    host operation.
    This is what makes mid-execution [snapshots](snapshots.md) safe.
    It also means `for line in f` is not supported.
- **Only regular files** can be read, written or opened.
    FIFOs, sockets and device nodes raise `PermissionError`, because mount I/O must never block on sandbox-reachable
    input.
    Existence checks and `stat()` still work on them.

The full list is in [`limitations/filesystem.md`](limitations/filesystem.md)
and [`limitations/open.md`](limitations/open.md).

## I/O timeouts and cancellation

Mount I/O has no timeout: it runs on the host between protocol turns, outside `request_timeout` and the sandbox
duration limits, whose clock is paused while the host works.
A stalled NFS or FUSE volume can block a feed indefinitely.
The pool uses blocking threads for filesystem operations, so a stalled call does not block other sessions' timers.

Cancelling the feed does not cancel an in-flight filesystem operation.
It keeps its blocking thread until it returns, and a read-write mount's write, rename or delete can finish after
cancellation was observed.
Use host storage whose availability and side effects are acceptable for the workload.

## The `os` callback

Operations no mount covers fall through to the `os=` handler, an [`OsHandler`][pydantic_monty.OsHandler].
It is called with keyword arguments, `name`, `args`, `kwargs` and `is_async`, and its return value is handed back to the sandbox.
Absorb the arguments you do not use with `**_future_kwargs`, so a later version can pass more:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import NOT_HANDLED, Monty


    def handle_os(*, name, args, **_future_kwargs):
        if name == 'os.getenv' and args[0] == 'STAGE':
            return 'production'
        return NOT_HANDLED


    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            print(session.feed_run("import os\nos.getenv('STAGE')", os=handle_os))
            #> production
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { Monty, NOT_HANDLED } from '@pydantic/monty'

    function handleOs(functionName: string, args: unknown[]) {
      if (functionName === 'os.getenv' && args[0] === 'STAGE') return 'production'
      return NOT_HANDLED
    }

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout()
    console.log(await session.feedRun("import os\nos.getenv('STAGE')", { os: handleOs })) // production
    ```

Returning the [`NOT_HANDLED`][pydantic_monty.NOT_HANDLED] sentinel declines the call, and the sandbox raises whatever it would have raised with no
handler at all.

The operations that can arrive are a fixed set: `Path.exists`, `Path.is_file`, `Path.is_dir`, `Path.is_symlink`, `open`,
`Path.read_text`, `Path.read_bytes`, `Path.write_text`, `Path.write_bytes`, `Path.append_text`, `Path.append_bytes`,
`Path.mkdir`, `Path.unlink`, `Path.rmdir`, `Path.iterdir`, `Path.stat`, `Path.rename`, `Path.resolve`, `Path.absolute`,
`os.getenv`, `os.environ` and `os.urandom`.
With `os_policy` configured to call the host, the handler also receives clock and sleep calls
(see [the clock](security.md#the-clock)).
Unseeded random generators and `random.seed()` call `os.urandom` only under `random_start='call_host'`
(see [random](limitations/random.md)).

`os` callbacks run in your process with your process's authority.
Everything in [designing a safe tool surface](host-functions.md#designing-a-safe-tool-surface) applies.
Python's `AbstractOS.urandom()` raises `MemoryError` before allocating when a request exceeds `max_urandom_bytes`,
1 MiB by default.
`OSAccess(max_urandom_bytes=...)` sets the cap; see [os limitations](limitations/os.md).

### Resolution order

Within a `feed_run`, an OS call is offered to the feed's mounts first, then to the `os=` handler, then falls back to the
sandbox's own no-handler error.

`feed_start` is different: it surfaces every OS call as a snapshot instead of answering it.
`snapshot.resume_auto()` applies the same mounts-then-`os` order, and `snapshot.resume_not_handled()` applies the
no-handler default explicitly.
Plain `resume(...)` bypasses both mounts and the handler, using only the supplied answer.

## A virtual filesystem

`pydantic_monty` ships a ready-made [`AbstractOS`][pydantic_monty.AbstractOS] implementation for when you want a filesystem with no host directory
behind it at all.
JavaScript has no equivalent class, so the TypeScript tab answers the same operations from a `Map` in an `os` callback:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import MemoryFile, Monty, OSAccess

    fs = OSAccess(
        [
            MemoryFile('/data/report.csv', content='name,total\nada,42\n'),
        ],
        environ={'STAGE': 'test'},
    )

    code = "from pathlib import Path\nPath('/data/report.csv').read_text().count(chr(10))"

    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            print(session.feed_run(code, os=fs))
            #> 2
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { Monty, NOT_HANDLED } from '@pydantic/monty'

    const files = new Map([['/data/report.csv', 'name,total\nada,42\n']])
    const environ: Record<string, string> = { STAGE: 'test' }

    function fs(functionName: string, args: unknown[]) {
      if (functionName === 'Path.read_text') return files.get(args[0] as string) ?? NOT_HANDLED
      if (functionName === 'os.getenv') return environ[args[0] as string] ?? null
      return NOT_HANDLED
    }

    const code = "from pathlib import Path\nPath('/data/report.csv').read_text().count(chr(10))"

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout()
    console.log(await session.feedRun(code, { os: fs })) // 2
    ```

For JavaScript `open` callbacks, return `new MontyFileHandle(path, mode, { position: 0 })` from `@pydantic/monty`.
The marker canonicalizes `mode` and exposes `path`, `mode`, `position`, `binary`, `readable` and `writable`.
Paths are virtual POSIX paths; `position` defaults to zero.
Returning a handle answers only `open`; reads and writes are separate callbacks, never operations on a live host descriptor.

[`OSAccess`][pydantic_monty.OSAccess] backed by [`MemoryFile`][pydantic_monty.MemoryFile] objects is fully sandboxed: content lives in host memory, path traversal cannot escape
to real files, and `os.getenv` sees only the `environ` mapping you passed.

[`CallbackFile`][pydantic_monty.CallbackFile] read and write callbacks run in the host and can reach real resources.
That is the point of it, but it means an `OSAccess` containing a `CallbackFile` is exactly as sandboxed as the callback
you wrote.

For anything more specific, subclass `OSAccess` and override the methods you want to change, or implement every
abstract method of `AbstractOS` yourself; the optional hooks (`path_open`, the append methods, `date_today`,
`datetime_now`, `time`, `sleep`, `async_sleep`) report [`NOT_HANDLED`][pydantic_monty.NOT_HANDLED] to Monty if you make
them raise `NotImplementedError`.
`time` receives the name of the `time` function that asked (`'time.time'`, `'time.monotonic'`, `'time.localtime'`,
...) so one hook can serve every clock or give each its own answer.

## Rust

Rust hosts hold a [`MountTable`](api/rust/monty-fs.md#mounttable) from [`monty-fs`](https://crates.io/crates/monty-fs) and service suspensions with
[`MountTable::handle_os_call`](api/rust/monty-fs.md#mounttable); `monty-pool` does this for you when you pass [`MountSpec`](api/rust/monty-pool.md#mountspec)s to [`Checkout::feed`](api/rust/monty-pool.md#checkout).
