# Built-in functions

Monty implements a subset of CPython's builtins. Referencing any name not
listed here raises `NameError` at runtime; there is no fallback to a host
Python.

## Implemented builtin functions

`abs`, `all`, `any`, `bin`, `chr`, `divmod`, `enumerate`, `eval`, `exec`, `filter`,
`format`, `getattr`, `hasattr`, `hash`, `hex`, `id`, `isinstance`, `iter`, `len`,
`locals`, `map`, `max`, `min`, `next`, `oct`, `open`, `ord`, `pow`, `print`, `repr`,
`reversed`, `round`, `setattr`, `sorted`, `sum`, `type`, `zip`.
`eval`, `exec` and `locals` are described in [eval_exec.md](eval_exec.md).

## Implemented type constructors (also builtins)

`bool`, `bytes`, `complex`, `dict`, `float`, `frozenset`, `int`, `list`, `range`,
`set`, `slice`, `str`, `tuple`. Exception classes (`ValueError`,
`TypeError`, etc.) are also names in the builtin namespace.

## Builtins that are NOT implemented

These raise `NameError`:

- **Code objects and imports**: `compile`, `__import__`.
- **Namespace introspection**: `globals`, `vars`, `dir`.
- **Interactive**: `input`, `breakpoint`, `help`.
- **Decorators / descriptors**: `classmethod`, `staticmethod`, `property`,
    `super`. (`@property` on functions is not recognized; use a method.)
- **Construction / coercion**: `bytearray`, `memoryview`, `object`, `ascii`.
- **Other**: `callable`, `delattr`, `issubclass`, `aiter`, `anext`.

`super()` is the biggest practical omission: with no class inheritance either
(see [classes.md](classes.md)), there is no inheritance mechanism at all.

## Behavioural divergences

- **No `__class__` on builtin values** — `[].__class__`, `list.__class__` and
    `list[int].__class__` raise `AttributeError`; only instances of Monty classes
    carry it (see [classes.md](classes.md)). Use `type(x)`.
- **Builtin methods are call-only** — reading one without calling it raises
    `AttributeError`, so `[1].append`, `'a'.upper`, `{}.get`, `dict.fromkeys`
    and `list.__class_getitem__` cannot be assigned, passed as a callback or
    reached through `getattr`. Call them directly (`list.__class_getitem__(int)`).
- **`hash(x)`** — Monty hashes `str`, `bytes`, `float`, `complex` and every container with
    its own algorithm, so the values differ from CPython's. Only `bool`,
    small `int`, and a `float` or `complex` equal to one of them agree: an `int` hashes to itself, which is what CPython does
    while `abs(x) < 2**61 - 1`, but CPython reduces modulo `2**61 - 1` from
    there up (`hash(2**62)` is `2` in CPython, `4611686018427387904` in Monty)
    and Monty hashes an `int` too large for an `i64` differently again. Monty's
    hashes are stable within a run and across runs of the same build (there is
    no hash randomisation), but never persist one or compare one against a
    CPython hash. `sys.hash_info` is not exposed, so the parameters CPython
    publishes are unavailable (see [sys.md](sys.md)).
- **`repr` of a dict being mutated by its own elements** — Monty iterates the
    live entries like CPython, but deletion compacts Monty's dense entry storage
    where CPython leaves a tombstone in place: a key deleted from inside a user
    `__repr__` running *during that dict's repr* shifts later entries down, so
    the entry after the deleted one can be skipped from the output where CPython
    would still print it. Insertions during repr match CPython (appended and
    printed), as do list (live length, mid-repr pops truncate / appends extend),
    `set`, `collections.deque` and `collections.Counter` (all snapshot, like
    CPython).
- **copying a dict or rebuilding a set re-hashes the keys** — CPython copies the
    hash table, so `d.copy()`, `dict(d)`, `{**d}`, `defaultdict.copy()`,
    `Counter.copy()`, `set(s)` and `frozenset(s)` never call a key's `__hash__`.
    Monty re-inserts each element, so a key with a custom `__hash__` sees it
    called again — observable through a counter or other side effect, and a
    `__hash__` that raises makes the copy fail where CPython's succeeds. Only
    `set.copy()` clones the storage directly and matches CPython. `copy.copy`
    inherits this for dicts (see [copy.md](copy.md)).
- **dict/set lookups under a mutating `__eq__`** — like CPython, a lookup
    (`in`, `d[k]`, `set.remove`, …) whose user `__eq__` mutates the container
    keeps probing rather than raising, and a mutation that only *adds* colliding
    keys never makes it repeat a comparison. Monty re-reads the colliding
    candidates after each comparison where CPython walks the live probe chain, so
    an `__eq__` that moves the entry being compared restarts the probe and
    re-compares the other candidates from scratch — extra `__eq__` calls CPython
    would not make (CPython restarts and re-compares too, but only after a resize
    or when that entry's own slot changed). An `__eq__` that adds a colliding key
    on *every* comparison never finishes in either engine; under a duration
    limit Monty raises `TimeoutError`. No mutation pattern can panic or corrupt either
    engine.
- **Set algebra under a mutating `__eq__`** — `-`, `&`, `^` and their method
    forms walk one of the two sets while user `__eq__` code can run. Monty
    raises `RuntimeError: Set changed size during iteration` if that code adds
    or removes an element from the set being walked, where CPython carries on
    over its live table and returns a result. The operand Monty is not walking
    is snapshotted before the operation begins, so mutating that one is never
    observed at all — `s | t` and `t.update(s)` see all of `s`'s original
    elements even when `__eq__` clears `s` partway through, where CPython's
    merge stops early. A mutation that empties the set being *probed* rather
    than walked is a resize to neither engine, but they still answer from
    different sides of it: with `s`'s own `__eq__` clearing `s`,
    `s.isdisjoint(t)` is `False` in Monty, which keeps the comparison that
    matched, and `True` in CPython, which restarts the probe and finds the set
    empty.
- **Dict-view set operators re-hash the view's own keys** — `d.keys() - s`,
    `|`, `^`, `isdisjoint` and the reflected forms collect those keys through a
    live, resize-checked walk that calls `__hash__` on each one. CPython probes
    with each key's stored hash and mostly does not call it at all. So a
    `__hash__` — or a colliding `__eq__` — that resizes the dict raises
    `RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration` in Monty where
    CPython completes, as in `d.keys() - s`; CPython raises too wherever its own
    walk observes the change, as in `s - d.keys()` and `d.items() - s`.
    `d.keys() & s` diverges the other way: Monty always walks the other operand
    and probes the live dict, so the view's keys are never hashed and the
    intersection completes, while CPython walks the view whenever the dict is no
    larger than the other operand — hashing each of its keys into that operand —
    and so raises where Monty returns a result.
    The operand that is *not* the view is snapshotted before the operation
    begins, so mutating that one is never observed. Absent mutation every result
    agrees. Set-to-set operators do not re-hash at all, and dict-view equality
    (`d.keys() == s`) raises exactly where CPython does.
- **`enumerate`, `zip`, `map`, `filter` and `reversed` are eager, not lazy** —
    each drains its source and returns a `list`, so `type(enumerate(x)).__name__`
    is `'list'` rather than `'enumerate'`. Observable several ways: a
    side-effecting callable runs for every item at the call itself rather than as
    the result is consumed; the whole result is held in memory at once, so an
    infinite iterator (e.g. `map(f, itertools.count())`) never returns and runs
    until a resource limit trips; the result can be indexed and re-iterated, which
    CPython forbids; and mutating the source from inside the loop body is never
    observed, so containers that detect mutation during iteration (`dict`, `set`,
    `collections.deque`) will not raise when looped over via one of these. `zip`
    and multi-iterable `map` stop at the shortest input, so pairing an infinite
    iterable with a finite or empty one stays bounded. A plain `for x in container` is lazy and does detect mutation.
    See [itertools.md](itertools.md).
- **Arity-error wording for some str/bytes methods** — a handful of
    keyword-accepting methods (e.g. `str.split`, `str.rsplit` and the `bytes`
    equivalents) report too-many-arguments as `split expected at most 2 arguments, got 3`, where CPython 3.14's Argument
    Clinic pre-counts
    positionals *plus* kwargs and says `split() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)`. Methods audited against CPython
    (`encode`, `decode`,
    `expandtabs`, `splitlines`, `replace`, …) already match; the remainder
    need a per-function `at_most_total` audit.
- **`getattr(obj, name)`** — if the resolved attribute would be an async
    coroutine, external function, or OS call, raises `TypeError: "getattr(): attribute is not a simple value"` rather
    than returning a
    bound method object. Use direct attribute access (`obj.name(...)`) for
    these.
- **`int(x, base=10)`** — string/bytes parsing accepts ASCII digits only;
    CPython also accepts non-ASCII Unicode decimal digits (`int('١٢')` == 12),
    which Monty rejects with `invalid literal for int() with base 10`.
- **`bytes(source)`** — an iterable of ints is not supported: CPython's
    `bytes([65, 66])` == `b'AB'`, Monty raises `TypeError: cannot convert 'list' object to bytes`. The int /
    str-with-encoding / bytes source forms
    all work. A count above `i64` (`bytes(2**70)`) raises the same shape of `TypeError`
    (`cannot convert 'int' object to bytes`), not CPython's
    `OverflowError: cannot fit 'int' into an index-sized integer`.
- **`slice`** — `start`, `stop` and `step` are readable, but `slice.indices(length)` is not implemented and
    raises `AttributeError: 'slice' object has no attribute 'indices'`.
- **`isinstance(obj, T)`** — `T` must be a built-in type (`int`, `str`,
    `list`, ...), a built-in exception class, a sandbox-defined class (see
    [classes.md](classes.md)), a `|` union of those (see [typing.md](typing.md)),
    or a tuple of those. Passing a host-supplied dataclass / namedtuple as the
    second argument raises `TypeError`.
- **`iter()`** — see [iter.md](iter.md) for iterator and `iter(callable, sentinel)` divergences.
- **`pow(base, exp, mod)`** — the three-argument form requires all integers and
    rejects negative exponents with `ValueError` instead of computing a modular
    inverse. Non-modular exponents whose result cannot be materialized raise
    `OverflowError` (see [resource_limits.md](resource_limits.md)).
- **`pow(base, exp)` and `**` with float operands and a real result** — overflow raises
    `OverflowError` like CPython, always worded
    `(34, 'Numerical result out of range')` (glibc's `strerror(ERANGE)`; CPython
    on macOS and Windows says `(34, 'Result too large')`), and `exc.args` is that
    text as one string rather than CPython's `(34, '...')` tuple.
- **`sorted(iterable, *, key=None, reverse=False)`** — `key` and `reverse`
    must be passed by keyword; positional forms raise `TypeError`.
- **`round(n, ndigits)`** — `ndigits` values outside the i64 range are
    clamped by sign. For floats this matches CPython (which clamps to
    `Py_ssize_t`); for an int `n` with a hugely negative `ndigits`, CPython
    tries to materialise `10**-ndigits` and dies with `MemoryError` where
    Monty returns `0` immediately.
- **`print`** — writes via the host print callback. `file=`, `flush=` are
    not honoured; `sep=` and `end=` are.
- **Identity of host-supplied callables** — host functions passed in as inputs
    (`MontyObject::function(...)`) lose their host object identity at the sandbox
    boundary. Live external functions are identified by lookup name, so distinct
    host callables with the same name share `is`, equality, `id()`, and `hash()`
    results. Once the last sandbox reference is dropped, a later conversion of
    that name may create a new function object.
- **Type objects across the host boundary** — a `type` object (a class, not an
    instance) round-trips in both directions.
    - *Sandbox → host* (external/OS-call argument, or a `.run()` return value): the
        type is reconstructed as the corresponding host class. Genuine builtins
        (`int`, `str`, `type`, `bytes`, `list`, `dict`, `property`, …) resolve to the
        real builtin; Monty's modeled stdlib types map to their host stdlib class:
        `datetime`/`date`/`timedelta`/`timezone` → `datetime.*`,
        `re.Pattern`/`re.Match` → `re.*`, the binary/text file types → `io.*`. The
        `pathlib.Path` class maps to `pathlib.PurePosixPath`, consistent with how Path
        *instances* round-trip, and instantiable on every host OS. A type with no
        faithful host class (e.g. an internal function or cell type) cannot be
        reconstructed and surfaces as an `AttributeError` from the host call.
    - *Host → sandbox* (input, or an external-call return value): the same recognized
        builtins and modeled stdlib types are preserved as type objects, so
        `isinstance(x, the_type)` works inside the sandbox. Recognition is by
        type-object **identity**, not class name/module, so a class that forges
        `__name__`/`__module__` to impersonate a builtin is *not* treated as one. Every
        `pathlib` path class collapses to `PurePosixPath` (it re-emerges as
        `PurePosixPath`). A host class Monty does **not** model (e.g. a user-defined
        class) is not preserved as a type; it degrades to a callable, appearing inside
        the sandbox as a `function` rather than a `type`.
