# Getting Started with Python

## Installation

```bash
uv add pydantic-monty
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install pydantic-monty
```

Requires Python 3.10 or newer.
The download is about 4.5 MB and there is nothing else to run: no daemon, no image, no API key.

`pydantic-monty` is a metapackage with no code of its own; it pins two distributions:

- [`pydantic-monty-client`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-monty-client/), the `pydantic_monty` module you import.
- [`pydantic-monty-runtime`](https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-monty-runtime/), the `monty` binary that the worker
    subprocesses run, shipped the same way `uv` and `ruff` ship theirs.

Installing the wheel places the binary in the environment's scripts directory, so there is no extra setup step.
Install `pydantic-monty-client` alone when the binary comes from somewhere else, such as a base image or a system
package.

`Monty(binary_path=...)` overrides binary resolution.
When it is omitted, the binary is resolved from the `MONTY_BIN` environment variable, then the environment's scripts
directory (where `pydantic-monty-runtime` installs it), then `PATH`.
If you are running untrusted code, pin `binary_path` explicitly rather than relying on `PATH`.

The same binary is also a REPL and a file runner; see [command line](../cli.md).

## First run

Everything in `pydantic_monty` starts with a pool of worker subprocesses.
Execution never happens in your process: a Monty process can never be made fully crash-proof against memory errors
triggered by adversarial code, so the interpreter always runs in a worker that can crash without taking your process
down.

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        result = session.feed_run(
            'double(x) + y',
            inputs={'x': 5, 'y': 1},
            external_lookup={'double': lambda x: x * 2},
        )
        print(result)
        #> 11
```

[`Monty()`][pydantic_monty.Monty] configures the pool; the workers are spawned by `with`.
`pool.checkout()` dedicates one worker to one REPL session.
`feed_run` executes a snippet and returns the value of its trailing expression.
`inputs` are values the snippet can read; `external_lookup` holds the host functions it can call.

## Sessions keep state

Session state — globals, functions, classes — persists across `feed_run` calls on the same checkout:

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        session.feed_run('x = 40')
        print(session.feed_run('x + 2'))
        #> 42
```

When the `with` block on the session exits, the worker goes back to the pool and the session state is gone.

## Getting values in

There are two ways to give the sandbox values from the host.

`inputs` binds values as globals eagerly, before the snippet runs.
Every entry is converted and bound once, whether or not the code uses it.

`external_lookup` resolves names lazily, when the code reads them.
A callable entry becomes a [host function](../host-functions.md) the sandbox can call; any other value is converted and
returned when the name is read; a name that is absent raises `NameError` inside the sandbox.
In the first example, `x` and `y` were bound before the snippet ran, and `double` was resolved when the snippet called
it.

A name present in both is served by the eager `inputs` binding.

### Which values cross the boundary

`None`, `bool`, `int` (arbitrary precision), `float`, `complex`, `str`, `bytes`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`, `frozenset`,
`Ellipsis`, `NotImplemented`, `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.timedelta`, `datetime.timezone`, named
tuples, exception instances, and the type objects of the data types Monty models (`int`, `str`, `datetime.date`, ...)
all convert in both directions.
Builtin functions and other type objects come out as a read-only [`MontyStdTypeProxy`][pydantic_monty.MontyStdTypeProxy]
carrying the name; see [host-value limitations](../limitations/host-values.md#lossy-outputs).
Class instances differ in each direction: a host instance enters only wrapped in [`ClassInstance`][pydantic_monty.ClassInstance], and a sandbox-defined
instance comes out as a read-only [`MontyClassProxy`][pydantic_monty.MontyClassProxy].
See [host objects](../host-objects.md).
Put callables in `external_lookup`, where they become [host functions](../host-functions.md); a callable in `inputs`
binds only a reference the sandbox still resolves through `external_lookup` when it is called.

POSIX paths convert too — `pathlib.PurePosixPath` and `pathlib.PosixPath`, which is what `Path()` builds on Linux and
macOS.
They come back as `PurePosixPath`, and a `PureWindowsPath` / `WindowsPath` is rejected, because paths inside the sandbox
are always POSIX.

Anything else is rejected with [`MontyConversionError`][pydantic_monty.MontyConversionError] before it reaches the sandbox:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyConversionError

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        try:
            session.feed_run('v', inputs={'v': Decimal('1.5')})
        except MontyConversionError as exc:
            print(exc)
            """
            Cannot convert decimal.Decimal to Monty value — wrap class instances in pydantic_monty.ClassInstance(...)
            """
```

## What the sandbox cannot reach

With nothing mounted, the sandbox has no filesystem; `open()` raises `PermissionError` because no mount exists, not
because a check blocked it.
Resource limits are set per session on `checkout()`; operations whose size is predictable are refused before the
allocation is attempted:

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyRuntimeError

code = """
try:
    open('/etc/passwd')
except PermissionError as e:
    denied = str(e)
denied
"""

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout(
        limits={'max_memory': 10_000_000, 'max_feed_duration_secs': 1.0}
    ) as session:
        print(session.feed_run(code))
        #> Permission denied: '/etc/passwd'
        try:
            session.feed_run("'x' * 10**12")
        except MontyRuntimeError as exc:
            print(exc.display(format='type-msg').split(':')[0])
            #> MemoryError
```

An infinite loop hits `max_feed_duration_secs` the same way, raising a [`MontyRuntimeError`][pydantic_monty.MontyRuntimeError] whose `exception()` is a
`TimeoutError`.
Type checking is also configured on `checkout()`:

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyTypingError

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout(type_check=True) as session:
        try:
            session.feed_run("x: int = 'not an int'")
        except MontyTypingError as exc:
            print('invalid-assignment' in exc.display())
            #> True
```

Sessions default to the worker's clock and entropy, with sleeps capped at ten seconds per call.
For reproducible runs, `checkout(os_policy=...)` can fix the clock, timezone and random seed, and skip sleeps:

```python
from datetime import datetime

from pydantic_monty import Monty

code = """
import random, time
from datetime import datetime
time.sleep(3600)
f'{datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d %H:%M} {random.random():.4f}'
"""

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout(
        os_policy={
            'datetime': datetime(2026, 1, 1, 9, 30),
            'sleep': 'zero',
            'random_start': {'seed': 42},
        }
    ) as session:
        print(session.feed_run(code))
        #> 2026-01-01 09:30 0.6394
```

See [resource limits](../resource-limits.md), [type checking](../type-checking.md) and the [security
model](../security.md#the-clock).

## Async

[`AsyncMonty`][pydantic_monty.AsyncMonty] is the asyncio counterpart.
Worker I/O runs off the event loop, and host functions may be coroutines:

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic_monty import AsyncMonty


async def fetch(url: str) -> str:
    await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
    return f'contents of {url}'


async def main():
    async with AsyncMonty() as pool:
        async with pool.checkout() as session:
            result = await session.feed_run(
                "await fetch('https://example.com')",
                external_lookup={'fetch': fetch},
            )
    print(result)
    #> contents of https://example.com


asyncio.run(main())
```

There is no event loop inside the sandbox — the host is the loop.
Sandboxed `async def` and `await` work;
see [`limitations/asyncio.md`](../limitations/asyncio.md) for the supported module functions.

Cancelling an in-flight session call loses the session; check out a new one before running more code.
The worker is discarded immediately, or by the next call if another call holds the session lock.
Cancellation while queued behind another call leaves the session usable because that request never reached the worker.
Cancellation does not undo host-function side effects or stop
[in-flight mount I/O](../filesystem.md#io-timeouts-and-cancellation).
The pool remains usable.

Synchronous `Monty` calls block the calling thread; Ctrl-C cannot interrupt a turn waiting on the worker.
Independent nested sync pools or sessions are supported from async host callbacks, but calling back into the same
session from its own callback deadlocks.
When embedded in a current-thread Tokio runtime, sync methods raise `RuntimeError` instead of blocking that runtime.

## Pausing at host calls

`feed_run` answers every host call for you.
`feed_start` hands control back at each one instead, as a snapshot you can inspect, store with `dump()`, or resume:

```python
from pydantic_monty import FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        snapshot = session.feed_start('greet(name) + "!"', inputs={'name': 'Ada'})
        assert isinstance(snapshot, FunctionSnapshot)
        print(snapshot.function_name, snapshot.args)
        #> greet ('Ada',)
        result = snapshot.resume({'return_value': 'hello Ada'})
        assert isinstance(result, MontyComplete)
        print(result.output)
        #> hello Ada!
```

`snapshot.dump()` returns bytes that a fresh session's `load_snapshot()` turns back into the same paused snapshot, in
another process or on another machine.
See [snapshots](../snapshots.md).

## Capturing printed output

By default the sandbox's `print()` goes to your process's stdout and stderr.
Pass `print_callback` to intercept it:

```python
from pydantic_monty import CollectString, Monty

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        collector = CollectString()
        session.feed_run("print('from the sandbox')", print_callback=collector)
        print(repr(collector.output))
        #> 'from the sandbox\n'
```

[`CollectStreams`][pydantic_monty.CollectStreams] collects `(stream, text)` tuples instead, so you can tell stdout from stderr.
Both cap collected output at 10 MiB by default; pass `max_bytes=None` to disable the cap.
That cap is separate from [`max_memory`](../resource-limits.md), and it is enforced in your process as the output
arrives, not by the worker.

Exceeding it fails the feed with [`MontyRuntimeError`][pydantic_monty.MontyRuntimeError] wrapping a `MemoryError`; call `exc.exception()` for the
`MemoryError` itself.
Sandboxed code cannot catch it, so a `print()` loop cannot swallow the cap.

A plain callable works too, receiving `(stream, text)`:

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty

seen: list[tuple[str, str]] = []

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        session.feed_run(
            "print('hello')",
            print_callback=lambda stream, text: seen.append((stream, text)),
        )
        print(seen)
        #> [('stdout', 'hello\n')]
```

Output arrives in chunks, not one call per `print()`.
The worker batches it, sending a chunk once about 8 KiB accumulates or the oldest byte has waited out
`print_flush_interval` — 0.005 seconds by default, settable on `checkout()`, and `0` to restore one chunk per line.
Whatever the interval, output is flushed before a host call and before a feed ends, so it never arrives out of order.

## Errors

Every Monty error subclasses [`MontyError`][pydantic_monty.MontyError]:

| Exception                                                     | Raised when                               | Session survives                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [`MontySyntaxError`][pydantic_monty.MontySyntaxError]         | The snippet does not parse                | yes                                          |
| [`MontyTypingError`][pydantic_monty.MontyTypingError]         | Type checking rejected the snippet        | yes                                          |
| [`MontyRuntimeError`][pydantic_monty.MontyRuntimeError]       | The code raised at runtime                | yes — but discard it after a resource limit  |
| [`MontyConversionError`][pydantic_monty.MontyConversionError] | A host value cannot cross the boundary    | from `inputs` yes, from `external_lookup` no |
| [`MontyCrashedError`][pydantic_monty.MontyCrashedError]       | The worker died, or hit `request_timeout` | no                                           |

`inputs` are converted before the snippet runs, so a rejected value leaves the session untouched.
An `external_lookup` value is converted mid-execution, while the worker is suspended on the name read, so the checkout
is discarded and reusing it raises `RuntimeError: this checkout has already been finished`.
Check out again to retry.

A `MontyRuntimeError` carrying `TimeoutError`, or a `MemoryError` from the sandbox heap, is a [resource
limit](../resource-limits.md#after-a-limit-fires) rather than ordinary sandbox code raising.
The pool leaves the checkout open, but the heap behind it is no longer trustworthy, so discard it rather than feeding it
again.
The duration budgets restart at the next feed, and after a `max_memory` trip a later feed may quietly succeed, so
neither failure stops you from feeding a heap you should have discarded.
`max_suspensions` limits host calls and raises a pool-generated `RuntimeError` such as `suspension limit 1000 exceeded`.
The feed ends cleanly; later code runs until it suspends again.

The print-collector cap is not one of these, though it looks identical from the outside: same `MontyRuntimeError`, same
`MemoryError`, same `memory limit exceeded: ...` message.
If you collect printed output at all — and the collectors are capped by default — you cannot tell the two apart from the
exception alone, and in the collector case nothing is wrong with the session.
See [`limitations/print.md`](../limitations/print.md).

`MontySyntaxError` and `MontyRuntimeError` carry a Monty traceback:

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyRuntimeError

code = """
def f():
    raise ValueError('boom')

f()
"""

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        try:
            session.feed_run(code)
        except MontyRuntimeError as exc:
            print(exc.display(format='type-msg'))
            #> ValueError: boom
            print([frame.function_name for frame in exc.traceback()])
            #> ['<module>', 'f']
```

`display()` also takes `'traceback'` (the default, a full CPython-style traceback) and `'msg'`.
`exc.exception()` returns the inner exception as a native Python exception object.

After `MontyCrashedError`, use a fresh checkout; the pool replaces the worker.
The error includes the worker's fatal message and exit status when available.
Other failures can also lose the session, including a hard memory-limit breach and a
[failed snapshot load](../snapshots.md#storing-and-restoring).
Retry only if any host side effects from the failed feed can safely repeat:

```python test="skip"
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyCrashedError

hostile_code = '...'

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        try:
            session.feed_run(hostile_code)  # even a segfault is contained
        except MontyCrashedError:
            ...  # the worker died; the pool already replaced it
```

## Configuring the pool

```python test="skip"
from pydantic_monty import Monty

pool = Monty(
    binary_path=None,  # explicit path to the `monty` worker binary
    min_processes=1,  # workers spawned eagerly and kept warm
    max_processes=None,  # cap on live workers; defaults to the CPU count
    checkout_timeout=None,  # seconds `checkout()` waits for a free worker
    request_timeout=None,  # hard per-turn deadline; kills the worker
    max_checkouts_per_worker=None,  # recycle a worker after N sessions
)
```

`request_timeout` is a per-turn host-side backstop: a worker that exceeds it is killed and the call raises
[`MontyCrashedError`][pydantic_monty.MontyCrashedError] with `timed_out=True`.
It catches hangs the in-sandbox limits cannot see, because those are only checked at interpreter checkpoints.
A loop of quick host calls resets it each turn; set [`max_feed_duration_secs`](../resource-limits.md) as well.

[`AsyncMonty`][pydantic_monty.AsyncMonty] takes the same arguments.
