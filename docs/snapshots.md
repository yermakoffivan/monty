# Snapshots

Monty can pause mid-execution, serialize the whole interpreter to bytes, and resume it later — in another process, or on
another machine.

It works because the sandbox holds no operating system resources.
There are no live file descriptors, no sockets and no threads to reconstruct: when execution suspends, everything that
matters is in the interpreter's own heap.

## Two things you can snapshot

| | Taken when | Restored with | Contains |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Session dump** | between feeds, nothing running | `load_session` | globals, functions, classes, time budget |
| **Snapshot** | mid-feed, at a suspension | `load_snapshot` | all of the above, plus the paused call stack |

Both come from `dump()` and are opaque bytes.
Using the wrong loader for a dump's kind raises, and both loaders are valid only on a fresh session, before any feed.

## Pausing at suspensions

`feed_start` is the suspendable counterpart of `feed_run`.
Instead of driving a snippet to completion it hands control back at every suspension:

```python
from pydantic_monty import FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        snapshot = session.feed_start('greet(name) + "!"', inputs={'name': 'Ada'})
        assert isinstance(snapshot, FunctionSnapshot)
        print(snapshot.function_name, snapshot.args)
        #> greet ('Ada',)
        result = snapshot.resume({'return_value': 'hello Ada'})
        assert isinstance(result, MontyComplete)
        print(result.output)
        #> hello Ada!
```

### The snapshot kinds

| Kind | Why execution stopped | Resume with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FunctionSnapshot` | A host function or OS call, or with `object_id` set a method call on a [host object](host-objects.md) (construction arrives as `__call__`) | `resume(result)`, `resume_not_handled()`, `resume_auto()` |
| `NameLookupSnapshot` | An undefined name was read, or with `object_id` set a lazy attribute of a host object | `resume(value=...)`, `resume()` to raise `NameError` (`AttributeError` when `object_id` is set), `resume_auto()` |
| `FutureSnapshot` | Every sandbox task is blocked on host futures | `resume({call_id: result})` |
| `MontyComplete` | Nothing — the snippet finished | nothing; read `.output` |

`FunctionSnapshot.resume` accepts four shapes of answer:

- `{'return_value': value}` — the call returned this.
- `{'exception': ValueError('...')}` — the call raised this exception instance.
- `{'exc_type': 'ValueError', 'message': '...'}` — the call raised this exception, named by type.
  Useful when you do not have the original exception object, for example when resuming a snapshot that was created
  elsewhere.
- `{'future': ...}` — the call returns a pending future the sandbox can `await`; settle it later at the resulting
  `FutureSnapshot`.

Each snapshot resumes at most once.

### Driving automatically

To iterate to completion without answering each suspension by hand, pass an `external_lookup` (and an `os=` handler if
you need one) to `feed_start` and drive with `resume_auto()`.
It resolves each suspension the same way `feed_run` would, one step at a time, so you can inspect or `dump()` each one
along the way:

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty, MontyComplete

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        snapshot = session.feed_start(
            'greet(name) + "!"',
            inputs={'name': 'Ada'},
            external_lookup={'greet': lambda n: f'hello {n}'},
        )
        while not isinstance(snapshot, MontyComplete):
            snapshot = snapshot.resume_auto()
        print(snapshot.output)
        #> hello Ada!
```

`external_lookup` and `os` passed to `feed_start` are captured **for `resume_auto()` only**.
The initial drive still surfaces every external call and name lookup as a snapshot, and a plain `resume(...)` ignores
them.

## Storing and restoring

`snapshot.dump()` serializes the paused worker.
A fresh session's `load_snapshot` restores it and returns the snapshot to resume:

```python
from pydantic_monty import FunctionSnapshot, Monty, MontyComplete

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        snapshot = session.feed_start(
            'fetch(url)', inputs={'url': 'https://example.com'}
        )
        blob = snapshot.dump()

    # later — restore into a fresh session and resume
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        snapshot = session.load_snapshot(blob)
        assert isinstance(snapshot, FunctionSnapshot)
        result = snapshot.resume({'return_value': 'page contents'})
        assert isinstance(result, MontyComplete)
        print(result.output)
        #> page contents
```

`session.dump()` between feeds serializes an idle session instead; restore it with `session.load_session(blob)` and keep
feeding:

```python
from pydantic_monty import Monty

with Monty() as pool:
    with pool.checkout() as session:
        session.feed_run('x = 40')
        blob = session.dump()

    with pool.checkout() as session:
        session.load_session(blob)
        print(session.feed_run('x + 2'))
        #> 42
```

## What restoring does and does not carry

- **The dump carries its own configuration.** `script_name`, resource limits and type-check state come from the dump,
  not from the `checkout()` that restored it.
- **The instance store does not travel.** Host objects sent before the dump are unknown to the restored session: they
  come back as `MontyClassProxy` (a host class, `type(x)` included, as `MontyClassTypeProxy`), method calls on them
  raise `RuntimeError`, lazy attributes raise `AttributeError`, and `ClassType` construction raises `RuntimeError`.
  See [`limitations/pool-architecture.md`](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/limitations/pool-architecture.md#host-api-behaviour-notes).
- **The accumulated time budget travels with the dump**, so a restored session resumes where it left off rather than
  getting a fresh budget.
- **The suspension count does not.** A restored session keeps the dump's `max_suspensions` but the pool counts from
  zero again, because the count is kept by the pool rather than the sandbox.
- **Mounts do not travel.** Host paths are never part of a dump.
  Pass the same `mount=` to `load_snapshot`, or the restored feed's filesystem calls degrade into unhandled OS calls.
  Any `'overlay'` writes made before the dump are gone — the restored overlay starts empty.
- **A restored `FutureSnapshot` cannot be driven with `resume_auto()`.** Its pending coroutines lived in the previous
  process.
  Resolve them by hand with `resume({call_id: ...})`.
- **Dumps are version- and transport-specific.** The bytes use a subprocess-specific envelope and carry a dump-format
  version; a build with a different one refuses them, so treat dumps as valid only within a single Monty version.

## Async

`AsyncMonty` sessions expose the same `feed_start`, `load_session`, `load_snapshot` and `dump`, with awaitable
`resume(...)` and `resume_auto()`.
A coroutine host function answered by `resume_auto()` is awaited concurrently: it yields an `AsyncFutureSnapshot` whose
`resume_auto()` settles the pending coroutines.

The sync `FutureSnapshot.resume_auto()` always raises — a sync session cannot drive coroutine host functions.

## Rust and JavaScript

In Rust the in-process API serializes through the free function `monty::dump`, which takes an idle or suspended session
by reference, and `Dump::load`, which returns the session plus its script name and type-check state.
Through `monty-pool` it is `Checkout::dump` and `Checkout::restore`.
See the [Rust quickstart](quickstart/rust.md#serialization).

In JavaScript the API mirrors Python's: `session.feedStart`, `snapshot.dump()`, `session.loadSnapshot(blob)`,
`session.dump()` and `session.loadSession(blob)`.

## Uses

- **Long-running agents.** Suspend at a tool call, persist the blob, resume when the tool answers, possibly on a
  different host.
- **Approval gates.** Pause at a sensitive call, store the snapshot, resume once a human approves.
- **Forking.** One snapshot restored into several sessions explores several branches from the same state.
- **Surviving restarts.** A remote server draining for deploy answers with a dump you can restore elsewhere.
