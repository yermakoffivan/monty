# `open()` and file objects

Monty's `open()` builtin returns a file wrapper supporting a subset of
CPython's file API. The list below tracks every known difference from CPython.

`pathlib.Path.open()` is wired to the same machinery: it prepends `self`
as the `file` argument and forwards to the same internal entry point, so
every divergence listed below applies equally whether the caller uses
`open(path, ...)` or `path.open(...)`. The only `Path.open()`-specific
quirks are in the "Path.open()" section at the bottom.

## Design note: no live host file descriptors

Monty **never** keeps a native file handle alive between OS or external
calls. `open()` itself yields an `OsFunction::Open` round-trip whose effect
(create / truncate / existence-check) the host performs and immediately
closes; every subsequent `read()`/`write()`/`append()` is a separate
one-shot OS call that the host opens, acts on, and closes again. The Monty
heap stores only path, mode, and small Python-visible state: no OS
handle, no buffered data, no descriptor number.

This is what makes subprocess `dump()` / `load()` safe: a session can be
serialized at a pause point and resumed later without dangling references to
host resources, including when using WASM worker sessions and snapshots.
It also means external processes can observe partial state
between calls, and that there is no protection against the underlying file
being changed or removed between calls, both documented further down.

## Mode strings

- `+` update modes (`r+`, `w+`, `a+`, and their `b` variants) are rejected at
    parse time with `ValueError: update modes ('+') are not yet supported`.
    Monty has no read-position state, so a write after a read would silently
    truncate the file via the one-shot OS write that backs `write()`.
- Exclusive creation mode (`x`) is rejected with `ValueError: exclusive creation mode is not supported`; it would need a
    dedicated race-free
    mount-table operation.
- The mode string is normalized to a canonical form at parse time
    (`'rt'` → `'r'`, `'br'` → `'rb'`); the original raw input is not
    preserved, and `file.mode` reports the canonical form. For *text* modes
    this diverges from CPython, whose `TextIOWrapper` preserves the string
    as passed: `open(p, 'rt').mode` is `'rt'` in CPython but `'r'` in Monty.
    Binary modes match, because CPython's buffered classes normalize too
    (`open(p, 'br').mode` is `'rb'` in both).

## `open()` arguments

Only `file` and `mode` are honored. The other six arguments
(`buffering`, `encoding`, `errors`, `newline`, `closefd`, `opener`) must be
at their CPython defaults; passing any non-default value raises
`TypeError: '<name>' argument is not yet supported`.

Two exceptions:

- `encoding="utf-8"` (any case, also `"utf8"`) is accepted as a documented
    no-op because Monty already uses UTF-8 for all text I/O.
- A wrong *type* for `encoding`/`errors`/`newline` (e.g. `encoding=123`)
    raises a typed `TypeError: open() argument '<name>' must be str or None, not <type>` rather than the generic "not
    yet supported" message.

Bytes paths are accepted but decoded as **strict** UTF-8, not via CPython's
`os.fsdecode` / PEP 383 `surrogateescape` behavior. A non-UTF-8 bytes path
raises `UnicodeDecodeError: can't decode bytes path as UTF-8`.

This is a deliberate divergence, not a "not yet implemented" gap. PEP 383
relies on representing invalid bytes as lone surrogates (`U+DC80`–`U+DCFF`)
inside the resulting `str`. Rust's `String` is strictly valid UTF-8 and
cannot hold lone surrogates without `unsafe` code or a parallel `Vec<u8>`
path storage type, neither of which is justified given that Monty paths
are virtual POSIX strings, not host-OS filenames. A lossy `U+FFFD`
replacement was also rejected because it would silently re-route an
`open()` call to a different (wrong) file rather than failing loudly.

If you have non-UTF-8 bytes you need to pass as a path, decode them
explicitly on the caller side (e.g. via `os.fsdecode` outside the sandbox)
before handing them to Monty.

## File object surface

The returned object is one of `TextIOWrapper`, `BufferedReader`,
`BufferedWriter`, or `BufferedRandom` depending on mode. The supported
methods and attributes are:

- `read()` / `read(-1)` — read everything remaining from the current
    position. On the first call this performs a full-file OS read into a
    heap-resident buffer; subsequent reads slice the buffer in pure Monty.
- `read(N)` / `read(None)` — read up to N chars (text) or bytes (binary)
    from the current position, or everything remaining for `None`. Same
    backing buffer as `read()`.
- `readline()` — read up to and including the next `\n`, or the remainder
    of the buffer if the final line has no newline. Returns `''`/`b''` at
    EOF.
- `readlines()` — return a `list` of all remaining lines (each ending with
    `\n` except possibly the last).
- `tell()` — current position. **Text-mode divergence**: returns a
    char-index, not CPython's opaque byte cookie. Round-trips through
    `seek()` correctly.
- `seek(offset, whence=0)` — reposition within the buffer for readable
    files (loading it on demand), or within tracked logical write state for
    write-only files. Returns the new absolute position.
- `write(data)` — full-file or appending write.
- `close()`, `flush()`, `readable()`, `writable()`, `seekable()`.
- `__enter__()` / `__exit__()` — `with open(...) as f:` works; see
    [with.md](with.md) for the shared protocol divergences.
- `name`, `mode`, `closed` attributes.
- `encoding` attribute on text files (always `"utf-8"`).

`open('data.txt').name` is `'data.txt'`, matching the supplied filename rather than the absolute path sent to the host.
Bytes filenames remain bytes, and `Path.open()` uses the path's string spelling.
Subsequent reads and writes still target the file opened originally, even after `os.chdir()`.

Everything else raises `AttributeError`, including: `truncate()`,
`fileno()`, `isatty()`, `detach()`, `buffer`, `raw`, and the iterator
protocol (`__iter__`/`__next__`, including `for line in f:`).

## Behavioural divergences

- All reads (bare `read()`, sized `read(N)`, `readline`, `readlines`) and
    `seek()` share a single heap-resident buffer populated on the first such
    call. The host serves only one full-file `ReadText`/`ReadBytes` per
    file; everything after is sliced in pure Monty. Memory cost: the whole
    file remains allocated and counts against the worker's allocator-backed
    `max_memory`. The buffer is **never invalidated**, so external modifications
    to the underlying file after the first read are not visible to subsequent
    reads.
- `close()` releases the cached buffer (matching CPython), returning its memory
    when no other value, such as `data = f.read()`, retains it.
- File I/O is rejected inside callbacks the interpreter evaluates in a
    synchronous context that cannot suspend to the host — the `key` of
    `sorted()`/`list.sort()`/`min()`/`max()`, `map()`/`filter()` functions,
    `iter(callable, sentinel)`, `defaultdict`'s `default_factory`, and dunder
    methods invoked implicitly. The first read that needs the host raises
    `NotImplementedError: <context>: OS function 'Path.read_text' is not yet supported in this context` where CPython
    would simply read.
- A read that *fails* in the host leaves the file in a retry-safe state:
    `pending_read` is cleared, the buffer stays empty, and `eof` is not
    flipped. A user-caught exception followed by a retry will re-attempt
    the OS load. This applies uniformly to bare `read()`, sized `read(N)`,
    `readline()`, `readlines()`, and `seek()`, and matches CPython.
- `seekable()` returns `True` for all open Monty file wrappers, matching
    regular CPython files.
- Text-mode `tell()` returns a **char index** rather than CPython's opaque
    byte cookie. Round-trips through `seek()` work correctly (`pos = tell(); seek(pos)` resumes the same position) but
    the raw integer differs from
    what CPython returns for non-ASCII content.
- Text-mode `seek(N)` accepts any non-negative char-index. CPython
    restricts `TextIOWrapper.seek` to `seek(0)`, `seek(0, 2)`, and cookies
    from `tell()`. Monty is more permissive here.
- `seek(-1)` raises `OSError("[Errno 22] Invalid argument")` matching
    CPython's `BufferedReader.seek`. CPython's `TextIOWrapper` raises
    `ValueError("negative seek position -1")` instead; Monty uses the
    binary-mode message in both modes.
- `seek(0, 99)` raises `ValueError("whence value 99 unsupported")`
    matching CPython's `BufferedReader`. CPython's `TextIOWrapper` uses a
    different `"invalid whence ..."` message; Monty does not.
- `read(N)` accepts only int or `None`. The `TypeError` message differs
    from CPython (CPython: `"argument should be integer or None, not 'str'"`;
    Monty: `"'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer"`).
- Write-only `seek()`/`tell()` maintain logical position state, so common
    `write(); tell()` and `seek(0, 2)` cases match CPython. Writes are still
    full-file or append one-shot host operations, so seeking backwards and then
    writing does **not** overwrite at that offset the way CPython's live file
    descriptor would.
- `readline(size)` and `readlines(hint)` are zero-argument only; passing
    a size/hint argument raises `TypeError`. CPython accepts both and uses
    them to cap the returned bytes/chars.
- File iteration (`for line in f`) is NOT supported: it goes through the
    `GetIter` opcode, which cannot yield to the host. Use `readlines()` and
    iterate the resulting list instead.
- `write()` to a text file requires `str`; to a binary file requires
    `bytes`. The error messages match CPython
    (`a bytes-like object is required, not '<type>'` /
    `write() argument must be str, not <type>`).
- Text I/O is whole-file UTF-8 with no error handlers and no newline
    translation; line endings written to a `'w'` file are preserved verbatim.
- `io.UnsupportedOperation` (raised by `read()` on `'w'` files, `write()`
    on `'r'` files, etc.) inherits from both `OSError` and `ValueError` for
    catch purposes, so `except OSError:` and `except ValueError:` both work as
    in CPython.
- No host file descriptor is held between calls (see "Design note: no
    live host file descriptors" above). The user-visible consequence is
    that external processes can observe partial state between writes, and
    Monty offers no protection against the underlying file being changed
    or removed between calls.

## Open-time effects

These match CPython:

- `'r'`/`'rb'` on a missing file raises `FileNotFoundError` at open time.
- `'r'`/`'rb'` on a directory raises `IsADirectoryError` at open time.
- `'w'`/`'wb'` truncates the file immediately, before any write.
- `'w'`/`'wb'` creates a missing file immediately, before any write.
- `'a'`/`'ab'` creates a missing file immediately, preserving any existing
    content.

## Path.open()

`pathlib.Path.open(mode='r', ...)` forwards to the same `OsFunction::Open`
round-trip as `open()` with `self` prepended as the `file` argument, so
all the rules above (mode rejection, kwarg validation, returned wrapper
types, open-time effects) apply identically. The differences:

- CPython's `Path.open()` signature lists only `mode, buffering, encoding, errors, newline` (no `closefd` / `opener`).
    Monty accepts `closefd=True`
    and `opener=None` at their CPython `open()` defaults as documented
    no-ops on this path too, and rejects non-default values with the same
    `"'closefd' argument is not yet supported"` / `"'opener' argument is not yet supported"` `TypeError` as `open()`.
    CPython would instead
    raise `TypeError: open() got an unexpected keyword argument 'closefd'`.
- Passing `file=...` as a keyword (which is meaningless on `Path.open()`
    because `self` already supplies the file) raises Monty's "multiple
    values for argument 'file'" `TypeError` rather than CPython's
    "unexpected keyword argument 'file'". Real callers do not use this.
