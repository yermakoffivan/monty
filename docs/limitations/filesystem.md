# Filesystem and sandbox boundary

The sandbox has no default filesystem access. The host explicitly mounts
real directories at virtual paths through Monty's [`MountTable`](../api/rust/monty-fs.md#mounttable); everything
outside a mount is invisible. Without any mounts, `open()` and every
`pathlib` I/O method raise `PermissionError` for every path (see
[open.md](open.md) and [pathlib.md](pathlib.md)).

## Virtual paths are always POSIX

Inside the sandbox, paths use forward slashes regardless of host OS.
`Path("C:/Users/foo")` is not a Windows path; it is the literal POSIX
path `C:/Users/foo`. Path repr is always `PosixPath(...)`.

Bytes paths are accepted but decoded as strict UTF-8 (no `surrogateescape`
/ PEP 383 round-tripping). See [open.md](open.md) for the full rationale.

## Mount modes

Each mount is configured by the host as one of:

- **`ReadOnly`** — reads allowed; any write (open with `w`/`a`, `mkdir`,
    `unlink`, `write_text`, ...) raises `PermissionError`.
- **`ReadWrite`** — full read/write into the underlying host directory.
- **`OverlayMemory`** — copy-on-write: reads fall through to the host
    directory, writes are captured in memory and never touch the host. Via the
    pool, the changes are discarded when the feed ends; each feed starts with
    a fresh overlay.

### Overlapping mounts cannot both be registered

A mount whose host directory is the same as, contains, or is contained by
another mount's, or whose virtual path is already mounted, is refused with a
`ValueError` naming both mounts — at registration, which via the pool means
when the feed starts, since that is where the per-feed mount table is
assembled. The bindings surface it as a `MontyRuntimeError` wrapping that
`ValueError`, like any other feed-time failure.

The access mode is checked against whichever mount the *virtual* path selects
(longest prefix), so a host file reachable through two mounts would take the
weaker mount's mode. In particular, mounting a directory read-write and a
subdirectory of it read-only would **not** protect the subdirectory — every
file in it would still be writable under the parent mount's spelling — so
that configuration is rejected rather than half-honoured. To expose parts of
a tree with different modes, mount disjoint directories.

Disjoint host directories at nested virtual paths (`/data`, `/data/sub`)
remain fine: each virtual path routes to exactly one mount. Two mounts on the
*same* virtual path are refused because only one of them could ever be
reached.

The same-directory check uses the opened directory's identity on Unix, so a
directory renamed between two mounts is still recognised; the nesting check is
lexical over canonical paths, since an open directory cannot name its parent.

## Only regular files can be read, written, or opened

Reading, writing, appending to, or `open()`ing a path that resolves to an
existing **non-regular file** (FIFO/named pipe, socket, device node) raises
`PermissionError`. CPython can open these files and may block waiting for a peer.
Mount I/O must not wait for a peer controlled by sandbox code.
Directories raise `IsADirectoryError` as in CPython.
Existence checks (`exists`, `is_file`, `is_dir`, `is_symlink`) and `stat()`
still work on special files.

The verdict is taken from the opened handle, not from a prior stat of the
path, so swapping a FIFO in mid-operation cannot get one past the guard: the
open itself is non-blocking and the descriptor it returns is bound to one
inode. The path is still stat-ed first, but only to phrase the error.

## Mount memory limits

Each mount has a configurable `memory_usage_limit`, defaulting to 100 MB
(100,000,000 bytes). Retained in-memory overlay entries and transient
filesystem results share the budget. Host files are read incrementally up to
the remaining budget without trusting file-size metadata; an operation that
would exceed it raises
`MemoryError: mount memory usage limit of 100 MB exceeded`. CPython has no
equivalent default limit.

Consequences of the shared budget that have no CPython analogue:

- Reading a file back needs transient budget for the result alongside the
    retained copy, so an overlay file larger than roughly half the budget can be
    written but not read back.
- Overlay deletions (`unlink`, `rmdir`, and the tombstones a `rename` leaves
    behind) record in-memory entries, so they too can raise `MemoryError` when
    the budget is exhausted.
- The `monty` CLI's `-m` mounts always use the default limit; there is no CLI
    flag to change it.
- Raising the budget above 256 MiB can hit the [message size cap](host-values.md#message-size):
    a mounted read whose result is too large raises `RuntimeError` inside the sandbox.

## Write limits

Hosts can configure a cumulative `write_bytes_limit` per mount. In
`OverlayMemory`, appending to an existing real file can materialize that
file into the in-memory overlay, so the existing file bytes count against
the limit along with the newly appended bytes.

## Sandbox guarantees

A mount opens a descriptor on its host directory once, at mount time, and
every operation runs relative to it, so nothing resolves from the filesystem
root.

- The mount is pinned to the **directory**, not its path: renaming the host
    directory does not detach the mount, and replacing it with a symlink does
    not redirect reads.
- `..` cannot escape, and neither can a symlink or an intermediate directory
    swapped for one mid-operation; such paths raise `PermissionError`.
- Path segments a host parser reads as absolute are rejected
    (`PermissionError`) on every OS and in every mount mode: any segment
    containing a backslash or starting with `X:`. So names CPython allows on
    Unix (`a\b.txt`, `a:b.txt`) are refused there too, since Windows would
    read them as drive-relative. Colons elsewhere are fine (`note:2026.txt`).
- The mount root itself cannot be renamed or removed: `rename` and `rmdir` on
    the mount's own path raise `PermissionError` in every mode, where CPython on
    an ordinary empty directory would succeed. The root has no name inside the
    mount, so there is nothing to detach it from.
- A rename is only serviced when source and destination land in the *same*
    mount. Any other combination (different mounts, or one side under no mount
    at all) raises `OSError` `[Errno 18] Invalid cross-device link`, including
    where CPython would report `FileNotFoundError` for a missing destination
    directory. Neither side moves.
- Null bytes in any path component are rejected (`ValueError`).
- Resolved paths returned to the sandbox (e.g. via `Path.resolve()`) are
    virtual paths, never host paths.

`/tmp`, `/etc`, `/proc`, `/dev`, `~`, and the host current working
directory are **not** available unless the host explicitly mounts them.

### Relative paths resolve against a virtual working directory

The sandbox's working directory is a virtual path the host sets on a
session's first feed (the first mount's virtual path by default, else `/`)
and that persists across feeds, so a relative path never reaches a mount as
written: the interpreter prepends the working directory, preserving every component.
The mount validates that absolute path before collapsing `.` and `..` lexically.
Mount-generated error messages name the absolute path supplied to the mount.
When no handler accepts a call, the default `PermissionError` names the normalized path. See
[os.md](os.md) for `os.getcwd()` / `os.chdir()`.

### `..` is resolved in the virtual namespace, not through symlinks

`..` is collapsed textually before anything touches the filesystem, so it
always names the lexical parent. POSIX instead resolves it *after* following
the preceding component, which differs whenever a symlink is involved: with
`ld -> sub/deep`, CPython reads `ld/../sibling.txt` as `sub/sibling.txt`,
while Monty reads it as `sibling.txt`, so the two resolve to different files.
The textual rule is what makes `..` unable to escape at all, so it is
deliberate; only paths mixing `..` with symlinked directories are affected.

### Path length is Linux's, measured before `..` collapses

A path over 4096 bytes, or with a component over 255, raises `OSError`
`[Errno 36] File name too long`. Both limits are Linux's and apply on every
host, so a path macOS (`PATH_MAX` 1024) or Windows would reject is accepted,
and a long one they would accept is not. The length counts the path as sent,
before `.`/`..` are collapsed: `'/mnt/' + 'a/' * 5000 + '../' * 5000 + 'f.txt'`
is refused even though it names `/mnt/f.txt`. CPython hands the uncollapsed
bytes to the kernel and gets `ENAMETOOLONG` too, so this matches, but Monty
applies it uniformly rather than deferring to the host filesystem.

The check runs before anything else looks at the path, which has three visible
consequences:

- `resolve()` and `absolute()` raise, where CPython returns the path. They are
    the only operations that would otherwise succeed on an over-long path, since
    they never reach the filesystem. Collapsing a path costs memory proportional
    to its length, so an unbounded one is refused rather than normalized.
- The rejection applies even where no mount covers the path, so an over-long
    path never reaches the `os` callback.
- `exists()`, `is_file()`, `is_dir()` and `is_symlink()` answer `False`, as
    CPython's do; `pathlib` swallows `ENAMETOOLONG` in the predicates.

The error quotes the path with its middle elided, the first and last 20
characters around a `…`, where CPython quotes it whole.

### At most 64 path components

A path naming more than 64 components raises the same `OSError` `[Errno 36] File name too long`, with the same three
consequences as the length limit
above. CPython has no such limit: it hands the path to the kernel, which
counts bytes, not levels.

This limit is Monty's own. Confinement resolves every path relative to the
mount's descriptor, and outside Linux-with-`openat2` that means walking it
component by component in userspace, so the kernel never sees the whole path
and its `ENAMETOOLONG` never fires. A 4096-byte path can name ~2000
components, and each level costs at least one lookup, so a single call could
fan out into millions of them. Components are counted as sent, like the
length, which can only over-count: `.` and empty segments are dropped by
normalization and `..` removes a pair, so anything within the limit as sent is
within it once collapsed.

64 is far above real trees (the deepest path in this repository, nested
`node_modules` included, is 20), but code that builds paths by repeated
`mkdir(parents=True)` on generated names can reach it where CPython would not.

### `absolute()` raises on a null byte

Null bytes otherwise behave as CPython's do, message for message. Only
`absolute()` differs: CPython returns the path without inspecting it, while
Monty refuses it at the boundary rather than carve out the one operation that
never reaches a syscall. It raises `ValueError: embedded null byte`, the
generic wording, since no syscall is involved to name.
The interpreter checks NUL bytes before dispatch, including when no mount is configured.
Direct Rust calls to `MountTable` check length first, so a path that is both over-long and null-containing
reports the length error there.

### A search-only host directory may not be mountable

Mounting opens a descriptor on the host directory. On macOS and the BSDs that
needs read permission, so a search-only directory (mode `0o111`) is refused:
[`MountDir`][pydantic_monty.MountDir] raises at construction, even though a host process can traverse it
and read known paths inside. Linux opens directories with `O_PATH` and accepts
it. Grant `r-x` on anything you intend to mount portably.

### Symlink targets must be relative (direct mounts)

**A symlink inside a `ReadWrite` or `ReadOnly` mount is followed only if its
target is relative; an absolute target raises `PermissionError` even when it
points back into the same mount.** CPython follows both. A descriptor has no
path of its own, so a leading `/` cannot be interpreted and "absolute but
inside" is indistinguishable from "absolute and outside". `OverlayMemory`
follows no link at all, see below.

Sandboxed code cannot create symlinks, so only links **already present** are
affected: `node_modules` installs, Homebrew/Nix store trees, build output
with linked artifacts. Only the links fail; the files themselves are readable
and no operation returns wrong data. `exists()`, `is_file()` and `is_dir()`
answer `False` rather than raising. To keep such links working, rewrite them
as relative before mounting.

### Windows locks a mounted directory against the host

Windows refuses to rename or delete a directory while a handle to it is open,
so the host cannot move or delete a directory for as long as it is mounted;
the attempt fails with `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`. Unix is unaffected. The
window is the mount's lifetime, which for `pydantic_monty` and
`@pydantic/monty` is the lifetime of the mount object, not one feed. Close it
([`MountDir.close()`][pydantic_monty.MountDir.close], or the `with` / `using` block) to release the directory
before the host touches it.
An in-flight feed retains its own reference until it ends.

### A mount follows its directory, not its path

The host directory is opened when the mount is created, and everything runs
against that descriptor. Renaming or replacing the directory afterwards is
therefore invisible to the mount: it keeps serving the same directory under
whatever name it now has, and a *new* directory created at the original path
is not picked up. CPython, resolving each path afresh, would see the
replacement. Recreate the mount to follow a path.

### `OverlayMemory` refuses symlinks entirely

**Any operation whose path contains a symlink — as the final component or an
intermediate directory, whether it resolves in-mount, dangles, is absolute or
escapes — raises `PermissionError`.** Reads, writes, deletes, `stat`,
`iterdir` and both ends of a `rename` alike. CPython follows the link.

An overlay entry is keyed by name, but a symlink resolves on the *host*, so it
names a file the overlay only knows by its target's name. Following one would
serve content the overlay has already replaced or deleted: write to
`hello.txt`, then read `link.txt`, and CPython gives the new text while a
following overlay would give the old. No in-memory representation fixes that,
so the mode refuses links rather than answering wrongly. The target is never
resolved, so the error reveals nothing about it.

Renaming a **directory that contains a symlink** is refused for the same
reason: the link cannot move with it and cannot be left behind.

`is_symlink()` still answers `True`; it reports only that the name is a link,
as CPython does. The other predicates answer `False`. Direct mounts are
unaffected and still follow relative in-mount links for reads and writes.
`mkdir(parents=True)` through an escaping symlink raises `PermissionError` in
every mode.

The refusal is a coherence policy, not the sandbox boundary, and it is not
atomic with the operation it guards: a host process that swaps a symlink into
the path — while it is being checked, or between the check and the read — gets
it followed. The descriptor still bounds the result to inside the mount, so
this is the same window a host already has by replacing a file outright
(above).

### `OverlayMemory` renames of real files

A rename records a mount-relative reference to the existing file rather than
copying its bytes, so it cannot come to name anything outside the mount. If
the host replaces the underlying file before the read, the read sees whatever
now occupies that path inside the mount, unless that is a symlink, refused
like any other; CPython, holding no such reference, would not find the
renamed-away original.

Renaming a directory that really contains an entry with a non-UTF-8 name
raises `OSError` (`directory contains an entry with a non-UTF-8 name`):
Monty's sandbox namespace is strictly UTF-8, so the entry cannot follow the
move. CPython renames the directory inode and never looks at the names
inside.

### Boolean predicates never raise

`exists()`, `is_file()` and `is_dir()` answer `False` for any path leaving the
mount, so a blocked path is indistinguishable from a missing one; raising
would confirm something is there to be blocked. CPython follows the link and
answers `True`.

`is_symlink()` is the exception: it does not follow the final component, so a
symlink that is itself inside the mount answers `True` even when its target
escapes. That matches CPython, and reveals nothing about the target.

## No live host descriptors

`open()` and pathlib I/O do not keep an OS handle alive between calls; each
`read`/`write` is a separate one-shot host operation. This is what makes
[snapshots](../snapshots.md) possible, and it means
external processes can observe partial state between writes. See the design
note in [open.md](open.md).
