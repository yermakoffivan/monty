# Security Model

Monty is designed to run code that a language model wrote and nobody reviewed.
This page describes what that buys you and what it does not.

Monty has a continuous bounty program for reported security vulnerabilities.
If you find a way out of the sandbox, do not open a public issue; report it privately by creating a
[security advisory](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/security).

## What "secure" means here

Monty is a **language-level sandbox**, not an OS-level one.
There is no container, no seccomp filter and no virtual machine.
The isolation comes from the interpreter itself: sandboxed code cannot express an operation that touches the host,
because the interpreter implements no such operation.

!!! note

    If you want Monty combined with OS-level isolation, see [Full Monty](server.md), the commercial version of Monty.

In practice that means:

- **There is no ambient authority.** With no mounts and no host functions configured, the sandbox cannot read a file,
    read an environment variable, open a socket, or spawn a process.
    Not "it is blocked" — the capability does not exist in the bytecode VM.
    The wall clock and OS entropy are the exceptions: every session reads the clock by default and seeds `random`
    from entropy, although even those can be disabled or customised; see [the clock](#the-clock) and [entropy](#entropy).
- **The interpreter performs no filesystem I/O at all.** It suspends with a description of the operation it wants, and a
    host component decides what to do about it.
    All filesystem code lives in a separate crate (`monty-fs`).
- **No FFI, no C dependencies.** Nothing in the sandbox can call into native code.

## The three host-access mechanisms

Everything the sandbox can reach outside itself goes through one of three mechanisms, and all are opt-in per feed.

### Host functions

Names the sandbox does not define are resolved against the `external_lookup` you supply.
A callable entry becomes a function the sandbox can call: execution suspends, **your** code runs on the host with your
process's full authority, and execution resumes with the result.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import Monty


    def get_price(sku: str) -> float:
        return {'A1': 3.5, 'B2': 12.0}[sku]


    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            result = session.feed_run(
                "get_price('B2') * 2", external_lookup={'get_price': get_price}
            )
            print(result)
            #> 24.0
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { Monty } from '@pydantic/monty'

    function getPrice(sku: string): number {
      return { A1: 3.5, B2: 12.0 }[sku]!
    }

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout()
    const result = await session.feedRun("get_price('B2') * 2", { externalLookup: { get_price: getPrice } })
    console.log(result) // 24
    ```

See [host functions](host-functions.md).

Monty guarantees that the sandbox reaches nothing you did not hand it.
It cannot guarantee that what you handed it is safe.
A host function that takes a path and reads it, or takes a URL and fetches it, is an unconstrained filesystem or network
primitive that you wrote.
Validate arguments in the host function as you would validate any untrusted input.

### Host objects and classes

[`ClassInstance`][pydantic_monty.ClassInstance] and [`ClassType`][pydantic_monty.ClassType] wrappers put a host object, or a host class, in front of the sandbox.
Every method call, lazy attribute read and `init=True` construction the wrapper allows runs **your** code on the host,
with the same authority as a host function.
`eager_attrs`, `lazy_attrs` and `allowed_methods` are name allow-lists that default to nothing, and `init` is a
boolean gate that defaults to `False`; `'all'` still skips underscore-prefixed names, and for `allowed_methods` it
exposes only the functions the class defines.
Nothing is wrapped for you: a method that returns another object fails conversion unless a `convert_value` hook wraps
it with a policy you chose.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from dataclasses import dataclass

    from pydantic_monty import ClassInstance, Monty


    @dataclass
    class Account:
        owner: str
        balance: float

        def withdraw(self, amount: float) -> float:
            self.balance -= amount
            return self.balance

        def close(self) -> None: ...


    account = Account(owner='ada', balance=100.0)
    # the sandbox sees `owner` and `balance`, may call `withdraw`, and cannot call `close`
    wrapper = ClassInstance(
        account, eager_attrs={'owner', 'balance'}, allowed_methods={'withdraw'}
    )

    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout() as session:
            print(session.feed_run('account.withdraw(30)', inputs={'account': wrapper}))
            #> 70.0
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { ClassInstance, Monty } from '@pydantic/monty'

    class Account {
      constructor(
        public owner: string,
        public balance: number,
      ) {}
      withdraw(amount: number): number {
        this.balance -= amount
        return this.balance
      }
      close(): void {}
    }

    const account = new Account('ada', 100)
    // the sandbox sees `owner` and `balance`, may call `withdraw`, and cannot call `close`
    const wrapper = new ClassInstance(account, { eagerAttrs: ['owner', 'balance'], allowedMethods: ['withdraw'] })

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout()
    console.log(await session.feedRun('account.withdraw(30)', { inputs: { account: wrapper } })) // 70
    ```

See [host objects](host-objects.md).

### Mounts and the `os` callback

Host directories are mounted into the sandbox at virtual paths, and only inside a mount can `open()` and `pathlib` do
anything.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    import tempfile
    from pathlib import Path

    from pydantic_monty import Monty, MountDir

    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:
        Path(tmp, 'notes.txt').write_text('mounted from the host')
        with MountDir(host_path=tmp, virtual_path='/data', mode='read-only') as mount:
            with Monty() as pool:
                with pool.checkout() as session:
                    print(session.feed_run("open('/data/notes.txt').read()", mount=mount))
                    #> mounted from the host
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { mkdtempSync, rmSync, writeFileSync } from 'node:fs'
    import { tmpdir } from 'node:os'
    import { join } from 'node:path'

    import { Monty } from '@pydantic/monty'
    import { MountDir } from '@pydantic/monty/node'

    const tmp = mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), 'monty-'))
    writeFileSync(join(tmp, 'notes.txt'), 'mounted from the host')
    {
      using mount = new MountDir({ hostPath: tmp, virtualPath: '/data', mode: 'read-only' })
      await using pool = await Monty.create()
      await using session = await pool.checkout()
      console.log(await session.feedRun("open('/data/notes.txt').read()", { mount })) // mounted from the host
    }
    rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true })
    ```

A separate `os=` callback handles operations no mount covers: the remaining `pathlib` operations, `os.getenv`,
`os.environ`, `os.urandom()`, and clock and sleep calls configured with `'call_host'`
(see [the clock](#the-clock) and [waiting](#waiting)).
[`AbstractOS`][pydantic_monty.AbstractOS] is the typed form of that callback; [`OSAccess`][pydantic_monty.OSAccess] implements it over in-memory files and an `environ` mapping
you supply, and overriding one of its methods replaces one operation.
JavaScript has only the callback form, so the TypeScript tab answers the same two operations by hand.
The session freezes the clock:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime

    from pydantic_monty import MemoryFile, Monty, OSAccess

    fs = OSAccess(
        [MemoryFile('/config.json', content='{"stage": "test"}')], environ={'STAGE': 'test'}
    )
    code = """
    import json, os
    from datetime import datetime
    from pathlib import Path
    f'{os.getenv("STAGE")} {json.loads(Path("/config.json").read_text())["stage"]} {datetime.now():%H:%M}'
    """

    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout(os_policy={'datetime': datetime(2026, 1, 1, 9, 30)}) as session:
            print(session.feed_run(code, os=fs))
            #> test test 09:30
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { Monty, NOT_HANDLED } from '@pydantic/monty'

    const files = new Map([['/config.json', '{"stage": "test"}']])
    const environ: Record<string, string> = { STAGE: 'test' }

    function fs(functionName: string, args: unknown[]) {
      if (functionName === 'Path.read_text') return files.get(args[0] as string) ?? NOT_HANDLED
      if (functionName === 'os.getenv') return environ[args[0] as string] ?? null
      return NOT_HANDLED
    }

    const code = `
    import json, os
    from datetime import datetime
    from pathlib import Path
    f'{os.getenv("STAGE")} {json.loads(Path("/config.json").read_text())["stage"]} {datetime.now():%H:%M}'
    `

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout({ osPolicy: { datetime: new Date('2026-01-01T09:30:00Z') } })
    console.log(await session.feedRun(code, { os: fs })) // test test 09:30
    ```

See [filesystem access](filesystem.md).

Confinement is structural rather than checked:

- Each mount opens a `cap_std::fs::Dir` descriptor once, at mount time, and every operation runs relative to it — `..`,
    symlinks and directories swapped mid-operation cannot reach outside the mount, because no resolution step could leave
    it.
- `..` and `.` are collapsed in the virtual namespace before anything touches the filesystem.
- Symlinks with absolute targets are refused in read-only and read-write mounts, even when the target is inside the
    mount; overlay mounts refuse symlinks entirely.
- Null bytes in any path component are rejected.
- Paths handed back to the sandbox (from `Path.resolve()`, for example) are virtual paths.
    A host path never leaks in.

`/tmp`, `/etc`, `/proc`, `/dev`, `~` and the host working directory are not reachable unless you mount them.
The sandbox's own [working directory](filesystem.md#working-directory) is a virtual path, so a relative path is
resolved inside the sandbox and reaches a mount as an absolute virtual path.

### The clock

`date.today()`, `datetime.now()` and the `time` module's wall clocks (`time()`, `monotonic()`, `perf_counter()` and
the conversion functions called without a time) are the only calls that read a clock.
All sessions default to the system clock read in UTC.
The session's `os_policy` ([`OSPolicy`][pydantic_monty.OSPolicy] on
[`Monty.checkout`][pydantic_monty.Monty.checkout] in Python, `osPolicy` on `checkout()` in JavaScript,
`OsPolicy` in Rust) configures the instant (`datetime`) and local zone (`timezone`) separately:

- `datetime='call_host'` delegates the clock calls to your `os=` handler; unanswered calls raise.
    Every `time` module clock arrives as the one OS function `time.time`, with the asking function's name
    (`'time.monotonic'`, `'time.localtime'`, ...) as its argument, so a handler can tell them apart.
- A fixed instant (`datetime.datetime`, `Date` or `DateTimeSource::Fixed`) freezes the clock.
- `timezone` sets the zone that naive `datetime.now()` and `date.today()` use and that `astimezone()`,
    `strftime('%Z')` and the `time.timezone` / `time.tzname` constants report: `'utc'`, an IANA name such as
    `'Europe/London'` resolved inside the worker from its tz database, or a fixed offset and name.

A fixed zone uses `{'offset_seconds': ..., 'name': ...}` in Python, `{ offsetSeconds, name }` in JavaScript,
or `SandboxTimeZone::Fixed` in Rust; a named one is `SandboxTimeZone::named(...)` in Rust.

Wall-clock time is a weak capability, but it is one: it is what makes elapsed time measurable from inside the sandbox.
A fixed instant removes it, and pins `time.monotonic()` and `time.perf_counter()` too, since they read the same clock.
`time.process_time()` is governed separately by `process_time`, which defaults to `'zero'`; `'elapsed'` deliberately
hands elapsed execution time back to the sandbox.
Under `datetime='call_host'` it learns whatever your handler answers; the default
[`OSAccess`][pydantic_monty.OSAccess] handler answers with the host's real clock and zone.
See [datetime](limitations/datetime.md#reading-the-clock).

### Entropy

`os.urandom()` is the only call that reads entropy from the host.
Through the pool the request reaches your `os=` handler like any other OS call; with no handler it raises
`RuntimeError`.
Python's default `AbstractOS.urandom()` raises `MemoryError` before allocating when a request exceeds
`max_urandom_bytes`, 1 MiB by default; `OSAccess(max_urandom_bytes=...)` sets the cap.
A custom handler allocates in the host process, outside the worker's memory limit, so it must apply its own cap.

The `random` module calls the handler only under `random_start='call_host'`.
By default it uses worker OS entropy.
For reproducible runs, configure a seed: `{'seed': ...}` in Python, `{ seed }` in JavaScript, or `RandomStart::Seed` in Rust.
An explicit `random.seed(42)` overrides this policy.
See [random](limitations/random.md).

### Waiting

Default system sleeps bypass your `os=` handler.
The sandbox caps each delay at `sleep_system_max`, ten seconds by default (`--max-sleep` in the CLI).
The pool waits on the calling thread under `Monty`, or with a timer under `AsyncMonty` and JavaScript, including browsers.
All pools answer `asyncio.sleep()` with futures, so gathered sleeps overlap and other sandbox tasks can run meanwhile.
Manual suspension drivers receive capped `system.sleep` or `system.async_sleep` calls.
`'call_host'` handlers instead receive `time.sleep` or `asyncio.sleep`.

A wait costs nothing against the duration limits, which measure execution time and stop while the sandbox is
suspended.
Each nonzero system sleep costs a suspension, plus another if an async future is awaited later.
`max_suspensions` therefore bounds sleeping loops.
The pool also enforces `max_total_sleep_secs`, charging capped delays before waiting and raising an uncatchable
`TimeoutError` if a sleep would exceed the total, independently of the worker's checks.
See [resource limits](resource-limits.md).

With `sleep='call_host'`, your `os=` handler receives uncapped delays, uncharged to `max_total_sleep_secs`.
The handler decides how long to wait; unanswered calls raise.
With `sleep='zero'`, both calls return immediately.
[`OSAccess`][pydantic_monty.OSAccess] caps every wait at its `max_sleep`, ten seconds unless you say otherwise.

Under [`AsyncMonty`][pydantic_monty.AsyncMonty] and in JavaScript a `'call_host'` handler may be `async`.
Its answer to `asyncio.sleep()` then runs alongside the sandbox's other tasks, so gathered sleeps overlap;
its answer to any other call is awaited before that session resumes, holding up nothing else.
The handler's `is_async` argument says which pool is calling, and
[`AbstractOS.async_sleep()`][pydantic_monty.AbstractOS.async_sleep] uses it to do this by default.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    import time
    from typing import Any

    from pydantic_monty import NOT_HANDLED, Monty


    def host_os(*, name: str, args: tuple[Any, ...], **_future_kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        if name == 'time.sleep':
            time.sleep(min(args[0], 0.05))  # never wait longer than 50ms
            return None
        return NOT_HANDLED


    with Monty() as pool:
        with pool.checkout(os_policy={'sleep': 'call_host'}) as session:
            print(session.feed_run('import time\ntime.sleep(30)\n"awake"', os=host_os))
            #> awake
    ```

=== "TypeScript"

    ```ts
    import { Monty, NOT_HANDLED } from '@pydantic/monty'

    async function hostOs(name: string, args: unknown[]) {
      if (name !== 'time.sleep') return NOT_HANDLED
      const seconds = Math.min(args[0] as number, 0.05) // never wait longer than 50ms
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, seconds * 1000))
      return null
    }

    await using pool = await Monty.create()
    await using session = await pool.checkout({ osPolicy: { sleep: 'call_host' } })
    console.log(await session.feedRun('import time\ntime.sleep(30)\n"awake"', { os: hostOs })) // awake
    ```

`asyncio.sleep` arrives the same way, with the delay as its only argument.
Its return value is ignored: the sandbox itself produces the `result` argument of `asyncio.sleep()` from the `await`.

## Crash isolation

Python's local [`Monty`][pydantic_monty.Monty] / [`AsyncMonty`][pydantic_monty.AsyncMonty] pools and the native
`@pydantic/monty` binding run every session in a `monty` worker subprocess.
Worker panics and aborts terminate the worker rather than the host.
For WebSocket sessions, see [remote workers](#remote-workers).

The WebAssembly build runs off-thread in a browser Web Worker or Node `worker_threads` worker.
Both support hard termination and replacement after WASM traps; environments without workers are rejected.
These are not subprocesses: JS-engine crashes or process-wide OOM can still affect the host.
Browser worker failures have no OS exit status; Node can report the thread's exit code.

When a worker dies, the pool observes the death, discards the worker, spawns a replacement, and the call raises
[`MontyCrashedError`][pydantic_monty.MontyCrashedError] ([`PoolError::Crashed`](api/rust/monty-pool.md#poolerror) in Rust).
The session is lost.
Subprocess isolation protects native hosts; WASM worker isolation has the limits described above.

Two more properties of the subprocess worker boundary matter:

- **Workers spawn with an empty environment** (Windows keeps only `SystemRoot`), so host secrets are never in a worker's
    memory to begin with.
- **The parent treats every frame from a worker as untrusted input.** A worker could in principle be compromised.
    Wire decoding validates values and enforces allocation budgets before growing decoded buffers.
    Generated repeated fields, including empty traceback entries and print segments, share the value decoder's budget.
    A worker that violates the protocol is discarded.
    See the [protocol allocation budget](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/blob/main/crates/monty-proto/README.md#children-are-untrusted)
    for what the per-frame budget counts and excludes.

From Rust, this is why [`monty-pool`](quickstart/rust.md) is the recommended entry point rather than the in-process
`monty` crate.

## Resource exhaustion

Untrusted code will try to allocate forever or loop forever.
See [resource limits](resource-limits.md) for the full picture; the security-relevant parts:

- `max_memory` budgets the bytes a worker requests from its global allocator, not process RSS.
    Per-allocation overhead, fragmentation, and memory obtained without the allocator sit outside the count.
    Size the limit with headroom, and keep the worker-level backstop.
- `max_feed_duration_secs` counts **execution time**, not wall clock.
    The clock is paused while the sandbox waits on a host function, so a slow host function does not consume the budget.
    `max_turn_duration_secs` bounds the same clock over one host round trip.
    Neither accumulates across feeds — there is no session-lifetime budget, so bounding what a session costs in total is
    the host's job.
- The in-sandbox time check only runs at interpreter checkpoints.
    Host-side backstops cover a wedged worker: `request_timeout` (a per-turn deadline; a loop of quick host calls
    resets it), and one grace per duration limit — `feed_duration_limit_grace` and `turn_duration_limit_grace` — each firing only if the
    session also set the limit it backs.
    Set `request_timeout` and at least one duration limit for untrusted code.
    `max_turn_duration_secs` does not close the gap named above: its clock also restarts at each host answer, so a loop
    of quick host calls resets it just as it resets `request_timeout`.
    `max_feed_duration_secs` does bound such a loop, because its clock runs for the whole feed; `max_suspensions` bounds
    the number of round trips.
    Across feeds neither applies — every in-sandbox budget restarts at the next feed, so a session fed repeatedly is
    bounded only by what the host counts and ends itself.
    Every local pool ([`Monty`][pydantic_monty.Monty], [`AsyncMonty`][pydantic_monty.AsyncMonty], JavaScript `Monty.create()`, [`PoolConfig::subprocess`](api/rust/monty-pool.md#poolconfig)) defaults
    `request_timeout` to no deadline; only [`AsyncMontyWebsocket`][pydantic_monty.AsyncMontyWebsocket] sets one, at 10 seconds.
- **After a memory or time limit fires, no guarantees are made about heap state or reference counts.** Discard the
    session rather than continuing to run code in it.
    The pool does not do this for you, and neither limit stops you: the duration budgets restart at the next feed, and
    after a `max_memory` trip a later feed may quietly succeed against a corrupted heap.
- Compilation of the fed source is not charged against the duration budgets.
    It has its own structural caps (AST nesting, bytecode operand sizes, comprehension nesting, `finally` expansion), but
    a host accepting untrusted source should still isolate compilation — as the subprocess and WebAssembly runtimes do.
    The parser grows its native stack outside the allocator's accounting, so a source longer than
    `CompileOptions::source_scan_threshold` (4 KiB by default, and fixed at that for Python and JavaScript hosts) is
    scanned for nesting before it is parsed; a shorter one can add at most a few MiB of stack the memory limit does not
    see, so a Rust host raising the threshold, or disabling the scan with `usize::MAX`, raises that exposure with it
    (see [source nesting depth](limitations/language.md#source-nesting-depth)).
    `eval()` and `exec()` compile inside the VM under the same caps, charged against the budget, and their code runs
    under the limits and host boundary of the code that called them.
- `max_suspensions` bounds suspension events per checkout.
    A snippet can otherwise retry a rejected host call while the duration budgets are paused.
    Each allowed `ClassType(init=True)` construction adds an instance-store entry outside `max_memory`.
    The pool aborts the first suspension over the limit with an uncatchable `RuntimeError`.

## Where the guarantees weaken

### Your own callbacks

Host functions, the methods, lazy attributes and constructors exposed through [`ClassInstance`][pydantic_monty.ClassInstance]/[`ClassType`][pydantic_monty.ClassType], the `os=`
callback, and [`CallbackFile`][pydantic_monty.CallbackFile] in the Python [`OSAccess`][pydantic_monty.OSAccess] helper all execute in the host process.
`OSAccess` backed by [`MemoryFile`][pydantic_monty.MemoryFile] objects is fully sandboxed; `OSAccess` backed by `CallbackFile` is exactly as
sandboxed as the callback you wrote.

### In-process execution

The Rust `monty` crate runs the interpreter in the calling process.
The language-level sandbox still holds, but crash isolation does not: an abort in the sandbox is an abort in your
process. The Python and JavaScript APIs do not offer an in-process execution mode.

### Remote workers

[`AsyncMontyWebsocket`][pydantic_monty.AsyncMontyWebsocket] (Python) and [`PoolConfig::websocket`](api/rust/monty-pool.md#poolconfig) (Rust) dial a remote worker instead of spawning a local one.
**A remote peer need not be a Monty sandbox at all.** It may be real CPython with no sandbox, no resource limits and
full host access, relying on deployment isolation — a container or VM per session — rather than on the interpreter.
None of the guarantees on this page transfer across that boundary; they become properties of whatever is running on the
other end.

### Pin the worker binary

The worker binary is resolved from the explicit path you pass, then `MONTY_BIN`, then the bundled platform package, then
`PATH`.
When running untrusted code, pass the path explicitly rather than letting `PATH` decide which binary gets to be your
sandbox.

### Deserializing snapshots

[Snapshots](snapshots.md) must be unmodified output from a trusted, compatible Monty producer.
The caller must establish their provenance and integrity before restoring them; Monty does not authenticate snapshots.
Use trusted storage or verify a MAC/signature before loading bytes received through an untrusted channel.
A checksum supplied alongside untrusted bytes is not authentication.

Invalid snapshots have no correctness or availability guarantees: loading or using them may return incorrect results,
panic, terminate the process, or fail to terminate.
Successful decoding does not establish that a snapshot is valid.
Worker isolation does not replace verification: restored state carries resource limits and can request host callbacks.
These rules also apply to direct serde deserialization in Rust.
Genuine snapshots produced while running untrusted Python remain supported; the trust requirement concerns the producer
and serialized bytes, not the Python source.

## The parts that are most security-critical

If you are reviewing or contributing to Monty, two areas carry most of the weight:

- `crates/monty/src/heap/` — the heap arena, free list and reference counting.
- `crates/monty-fs/src/mount_table.rs` — the mount boundary: the `Dir` descriptor every filesystem operation runs
    against, with `path_security.rs` beside it holding the virtual-path policy.

Changes to any of them need careful security review.
The repository's [`review-security` skill](https://github.com/pydantic/monty/tree/main/.agents/skills/review-security)
exists for exactly that.
